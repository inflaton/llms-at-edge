4061,Quarantine Requirements in China Reportedly Impact Air Cargo; Economic Disruptions Persist,"On Thursday, it was reported that the operations of U.S. air cargo companies like FedEx and UPS had been affected by novel coronavirus (COVID-19) quarantine and testing measures imposed by some officials in China. There have been reports that Chinese officials told some flight crews that they would be required to quarantine in a government facility, despite the standard practice of crews being allowed to isolate in a hotel and fly out later. These restrictions vary depending on the city and province, with officials in Shanghai reportedly not imposing such measures in order to facilitate air cargo. Pilots have also been subjected to an enhanced nose and throat testing policy and protests from the pilots have resulted in visa cancellation threats. 



Assessment: The disruptions experienced by air cargo operators highlight the continued impact that quarantine measures are having on China’s economy and associated supply chains, despite the country largely having their outbreak under control. The government is taking significant measures in order to prevent a resurgence of cases, with 600,000 people in Henan Province being locked down after three new cases were reported in the county of Jia. Even though China’s economy is restarting, the collapse in global demand is having a severe impact on Chinese manufacturers, who are facing widespread order cancellations. Chinese ports are expecting shipping volumes to decrease by up to ten percent in the second quarter of the year as a result. Individuals are advised to expect supply chain disruptions associated with China to continue, either due to quarantine measures, new lockdowns, financial pressure on factories, or a variety of other factors.",Minor,China,2020-03-04 22:35:00,,,False,['shanghai'],True,True,"Quarantine Requirements in China Reportedly Impact Air Cargo; Economic Disruptions Persist On Thursday, it was reported that the operations of U.S. air cargo companies like FedEx and UPS had been affected by novel coronavirus (COVID-19) quarantine and testing measures imposed by some officials in China.
