"On Thursday, it was reported that the operations of U.S. air cargo companies like FedEx and UPS had been affected by novel coronavirus (COVID-19) quarantine and testing measures imposed by some officials in China. There have been reports that Chinese officials told some flight crews that they would be required to quarantine in a government facility, despite the standard practice of crews being allowed to isolate in a hotel and fly out later. These restrictions vary depending on the city and province, with officials in Shanghai reportedly not imposing such measures in order to facilitate air cargo. Pilots have also been subjected to an enhanced nose and throat testing policy and protests from the pilots have resulted in visa cancellation threats. 



Assessment: The disruptions experienced by air cargo operators highlight the continued impact that quarantine measures are having on China’s economy and associated supply chains, despite the country largely having their outbreak under control. The government is taking significant measures in order to prevent a resurgence of cases, with 600,000 people in Henan Province being locked down after three new cases were reported in the county of Jia. Even though China’s economy is restarting, the collapse in global demand is having a severe impact on Chinese manufacturers, who are facing widespread order cancellations. Chinese ports are expecting shipping volumes to decrease by up to ten percent in the second quarter of the year as a result. Individuals are advised to expect supply chain disruptions associated with China to continue, either due to quarantine measures, new lockdowns, financial pressure on factories, or a variety of other factors.","thursday reported operation u.s. air cargo company like fedex ups affected novel coronavirus covid-19 quarantine testing measure imposed official china report chinese official told flight crew would required quarantine government facility despite standard practice crew allowed isolate hotel fly later restriction vary depending city province official shanghai reportedly imposing measure order facilitate air cargo pilot also subjected enhanced nose throat testing policy protest pilot resulted visa cancellation threat assessment disruption experienced air cargo operator highlight continued impact quarantine measure china ’ economy associated supply chain despite country largely outbreak control government taking significant measure order prevent resurgence case 600,000 people henan province locked three new case reported county jia even though china ’ economy restarting collapse global demand severe impact chinese manufacturer facing widespread order cancellation chinese port expecting shipping volume decrease ten percent second quarter year result individual advised expect supply chain disruption associated china continue either due quarantine measure new lockdown financial pressure factory variety factor",Regulatory Advisory,Administrative Issue

"As we usher in 2019, China and a few Asian countries with large ethnic Chinese populations are gearing up for another festive season to celebrate the traditional Chinese New Year (CNY), also known as the Spring Festival or the Lunar New Year. The year of the ‘Pig’ will commence from February 5, 2019 according to the Chinese Zodiac, which is based on a twelve-year cycle with 12 animals being designated to a year each.

The CNY holiday season is a time when millions of workers travel back home to celebrate the festivities with their families and when businesses and factories shutdown for three to four weeks to allow workers to return to their hometowns. Although the duration of the holiday is officially about a week, precedents indicate that factories normally shut down 10-days prior to the holidays to allow travel time for their employees. This indicates that factories in China are highly likely to be closed starting from the last week of January 2019. Furthermore, some employers allow additional time for the employees to travel back to the city after the holidays. Thus, the period before and after CNY not only heavily impacts the Chinese manufacturing industry but simultaneously creates a domino effect of disruptions to international businesses that rely on production in China.  

Before the CNY, factories normally face a production peak period to get their products out in order to make up for the time lost during the holidays as well as because of an expected slow ramp up in business afterwards. Precedents indicate that it is quite common for most workers to not return to work or take an extended period to get back to work. Moreover, CNY is also the time for ocean and air freight prices to increase as it takes advantage of the high demand for capacity.  

Ocean freight prices have been on the rise since even before Christmas 2018 as goods produced in China rushed to be imported to the US ahead of January 1, 2019 to avoid the 25 percent increase in tariff.  Earlier reports had indicated that tariffs would be raised from 10 to 25 percent on Chinese imports to the US at the beginning of 2019. However, the tariff increment has been pushed back to March 1, 2019 as negotiations between the two countries continue. Nevertheless, ocean freight rates traditionally increase in January prior to the Lunar New Year from China to the rest of the world due to the high demand for capacity. According to industry sources, cargo rush and tight spaces are expected to contribute to a rate increase in January during the pre-Lunar New Year period; the increment will affect shipping lanes from Asia Pacific to Europe, Latin America, North America, Middle East and North Africa as well as within the Asia Pacific region.

Moreover, ports in China may face slight congestion before CNY as a result of shippers rushing to get their cargo out before ports face capacity constraints. This also reflects carriers’ plans, as a few vessels have already scheduled blank sailings or have revised their ETAs to some Chinese ports, including Shanghai, Qingdao and Kaohsiung in Taiwan by avoiding the first and second weeks of February. 

Due to the rising popularity of B2C eCommerce around the world, there is a trend for consumers to purchase products of Western brands online prior to the Lunar New Year. Thus, the upsurge in demand to get goods on time has caused an upward price pressure for air freight carriers. According to industry sources, capacity for air freight from Asia Pacific to Europe and North America are bound to be affected as demands are forecasted to exceed capacity in January; demands for capacity is also expected to be high for air routes from Europe and North America flying to Asia with the possibility of forming cargo backlogs until the Lunar New Year.

"The United States on 3 November held elections for president, along with 35 Senate contests and all 435 House of Representatives seats.According to the latest returns (as of the morning of 4 November), former vice-president Joe Biden holds a tenuous advantage of 238 to 216 in the electoral college over President Donald Trump. However, as counting continues, President Trump held small leads in uncalled critical swing states Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, and Georgia, with Biden leading in Wisconsin. If Trump wins in four of these five states, he will almost certainly retain the presidency. However, many of the outstanding early and mail-in ballots in these states still need to be counted, and these votes appear to be in large cities that trend Democratic. President Trump outperformed many polling estimates that suggested that Biden would win easily, as Trump carried toss-up states such as Texas, Florida, and Ohio. As in 2016, many state polls conducted by private polling companies appear to have been wildly off, including in Florida and Wisconsin. Due to the closeness of the race, congressional districts in Nebraska and Maine, who award electors individually, will become increasingly crucial if the race ends in a tie, as state US House of Representatives’ delegations would be expected to break the logjam. If the president wins, it would be the second time that he would have done so while losing the vote nationally, as Biden leads Trump by roughly 1.5%. Undeclared states were expecting to finish counting votes over Wednesday and up until Friday, but the pressure of such a close contest is likely to push state governments to finish earlier. In the Senate, it appears that an overall majority will only be determined by one or two run-off elections in Georgia in January 2021. Democrats had hoped to obtain a clear Senate majority, but appear to have lost close races in South Carolina, Iowa, and Montana, and were losing in North Carolina and Maine. However, Democrats did pick up seats in Arizona and Colorado, which means that they are likely to have anywhere between 47 and 50 senators (out of 100) in the new Congress. In the case of a Biden victory, a Republican-held Senate would greatly inhibit his administration from enacting policies, as legislative gridlock would be likely to arise, leaving Biden primarily only with executive orders to enact his overall agenda. Conversely, a re-elected Trump with a slight Senate majority would be likely to result in Republicans seeking to reach an agreement with House Democrats to pass a fiscal stimulus package to assist the business community, although one that would be smaller than March’s USD2-trillion stimulus. It is also likely that a narrow Republican Senate and a Trump or a Biden White House would attempt to pass an infrastructure package, an idea for which has rare bipartisan support. As of the time of publication, levels of election-related politically motivated violence have been low, but a contested election will result in a higher likelihood of violent protests and acts of terrorism. Due to the closeness of the race, isolated altercations between pro- and anti-Trump supporters, as occurred in the run-up to the election, are likely to escalate, especially if the vote counts continue for several days, as is likely. Large protests by left-wing groups have been called in many cities following a statement by President Trump, in which he asserted that Democrats are attempting to steal the election. Although the vast majority of protests is very likely to be peaceful, some will probably result in vandalism to storefronts and office buildings, especially in downtown locations, and altercations between protesters and the police. Isolated looting and arson is also likely in downtown areas in cities such as New York, Washington, Atlanta, Portland, and Seattle, among others. As seen in the arrests of 13 individuals who belonged to a Michigan militia and allegedly intended to abduct the governor of that state on 8 October, the risk of a terrorist attack against politicians, party headquarters, and government buildings has increased and remain elevated.

"On Wednesday, the US Embassy in Hanoi and Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City issued the following Health and Travel Alert: 



“Location: Vietnam



This is an update from the U.S. Embassy Hanoi and Consulate General Ho Chi Minh City to assist U.S. citizens in remaining informed during the evolving Coronavirus (COVID-19) situation in Vietnam.



Daily COVID-19 Numbers:

As of April 29, Vietnam has reported 270 confirmed cases of COVID-19 within its borders since the virus first became known. To date, 222 people have recovered and have been released from the hospital.



Important Information for U.S. Citizens:

As the COVID-19 situation continues to weaken economies worldwide, the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security informed the public of an expected rise in crime in Vietnam.

"On 3 August, agricultural organisations ended negotiations with the government after their demands were not resolved and announced plans for sustained strikes from 8 August. Strikes by thousands of workers between 24 and 27 July previously included road blockades in the provinces of Herrera, Los Santos and Panama Province. Agricultural producers in the meat, dairy, rice, grain and vegetable sectors are demanding that the government increase technical funding, reduce unrestricted imports granted by free trade agreements, and dissolve the Panamanian Agency of Security and Food (Autoridad Panamena de Seguridad de Alimentos: AUPSA), which workers have blamed for allowing uncontrolled agricultural imports into Panama. The government has been negotiating with agricultural producers since 2016 to address these grievances. Legislation to reduce the functions of AUPSA and absorb the body into the Ministry of Development of Agriculture and Livestock (Ministerio de Desarrollo Agropecuario: MIDA) was vetoed twice, before being passed during a third National Assembly debate in March 2018.The government is unlikely to significantly restrict imports across various sectors or jeopardise existing free trade agreements. Despite the legislation's passage, the Panamanian Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (La Camara de Comercio, Industrias y Agricultura de Panama: CCIAP) and producers have demanded greater reforms in the sector, including the removal of price controls established by the government since 2014 and increased government funding. Protests are likely to recur in coming weeks, involving road blocks affecting the Pan-American highway between Chiriqui and Los Santos provinces lasting a few hours at most. Increased revenue from exports, which so far predominantly derive from sugar, coffee, fish, bananas and pineapple products, would improve the likelihood of funding becoming available to support struggling domestic producers next year. The government set up its first foreign based Agro-commercial office in Rotterdam, Holland on 31 July, indicating its commitment to expanding domestic production, at least for existing exports. If the major opposition party Democratic Revolutionary Party (Partido Democratico Revolucionario: PRD), who support the protests, win the 2019 general elections, this would likely ensure more state funding is allocated to support domestic production.

"On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order ending Washington’s preferential treatment of Hong Kong, citing the new national security law enacted in the city by China. According to the text of the document released by the White House, the order revokes the special trade status awarded to Hong Kong under US law and freezes any US assets held by individuals involved in “actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions in Hong Kong,” presumably a reference to those who aide in the enforcement the new security law. It also ended special treatment for Hong Kong passport holders, who will now be treated the same as China passport holders. Also Tuesday, President Trump signed a bill that penalizes banks who do business with Chinese authorities who implement the new security law.



Assessment: From a practical standpoint, the impact of Tuesday’s move remains to be seen. While some sources have suggested that the order will have little tangible effect on Hong Kong or China, others have speculated that it could tarnish the former’s reputation as an autonomous, open territory with wide-ranging freedoms, potentially dampening business engagement and academia. Meanwhile, others have raised the possibility that the move could actually hurt Washington’s economic interests, as Hong Kong accounted for the largest bilateral US goods trade surplus last year, and more than 1,300 American companies operate there, including major financial institutions. Politically, the development is likely to further sour relations between Washington and Beijing, which have grown increasingly rocky of late over a variety of issues, including the COVID-19 pandemic, trade, alleged human rights violations, and claims in the disputed South China Sea. Indeed, Chinese officials pledged diplomatic retaliation on Wednesday, including the imposition of unspecified sanctions against American individuals and entities. Thus, it reasonable to anticipate that the recent bout of tit-for-tat diplomacy between the parties will continue.","tuesday u president donald trump signed executive order ending washington ’ preferential treatment hong kong citing new national security law enacted city china according text document released white house order revoke special trade status awarded hong kong u law freeze u asset held individual involved “ action policy undermine democratic process institution hong kong ” presumably reference aide enforcement new security law also ended special treatment hong kong passport holder treated china passport holder also tuesday president trump signed bill penalizes bank business chinese authority implement new security law assessment practical standpoint impact tuesday ’ move remains seen source suggested order little tangible effect hong kong china others speculated could tarnish former ’ reputation autonomous open territory wide-ranging freedom potentially dampening business engagement academia meanwhile others raised possibility move could actually hurt washington ’ economic interest hong kong accounted largest bilateral u good trade surplus last year 1,300 american company operate including major financial institution politically development likely sour relation washington beijing grown increasingly rocky late variety issue including covid-19 pandemic trade alleged human right violation claim disputed south china sea indeed chinese official pledged diplomatic retaliation wednesday including imposition unspecified sanction american individual entity thus reasonable anticipate recent bout tit-for-tat diplomacy party continue","Regulatory Advisory, Political Info / Event",Administrative Issue

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Wednesday that parliament would be suspended for more than a month ahead of its resumption in mid-October with the presentation of the new government s goals. The announcement sparked backlash over the prolonged suspension ahead of the scheduled date for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union on October 31, with accusations that Johnson was attempting to circumvent parliament on Brexit. Same-day protests were called immediately after the announcement. The move has also at least temporarily brought together various political factions seeking to prevent the UK leaving the EU without a deal. The suspension of parliament and the battle over Brexit developments are expected to spur protest activity around the UK in the coming months. The prospect of a no-deal Brexit continues to drive volatility and associated developments should be followed closely due to the potential impacts across business activities and everyday life in the UK.

Recent Developments

On Wednesday, Prime Minister Johnson announced that parliament would be suspended in September ahead of a Queen s Speech scheduled for October 14 laying out the new prime minister s legislative agenda. The queen had approved the suspension, also called the prorogation, of parliament. The announcement of the lengthy suspension of parliament ahead of the current deadline for the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, October 31, immediately sparked controversy and condemnation. Critics argued that the suspension, planned to occur by September 12, could cut the amount of time in half that parliament would have to debate Brexit after returning from the summer break. The suspension has also sparked accusations of the government committing a constitutional breach to press through its Brexit agenda by attempting to circumvent parliament. More than one million people signed a petition Wednesday opposing the suspension of parliament. Multiple court filings are seeking to thwart the extended suspension of parliament and a prospective no-deal Brexit as well.

Protests were called in major cities around the UK immediately following the announcement of the upcoming suspension of parliament, including London, Cardiff, Manchester, and Glasgow. In London on Wednesday evening, thousands of protesters convened first at College Green in Westminster before marching just north to Parliament Square and the Whitehall area. The impromptu protest disrupted traffic in the vicinity of parliament and drew an increased police presence to monitor the demonstration, though the event passed off without violence. The political organization Momentum, supportive of Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, has expressed support for protests and blockades in opposition to the latest developments.

Parliament is set to reconvene on Tuesday, September 3, and the suspension of parliament soon after has brought various parties and individual lawmakers opposed to the actions of Johnson s government into closer alignment. Cross-party discussions have focused on immediately undertaking a legislative effort to prevent a no-deal Brexit from occurring. Prioritizing an attempt to block the prospect of leaving the EU without an agreement and thwart the suspension of parliament, Corbyn agreed to hold off on a no-confidence vote for the time being. However, the prospect of a looming suspension of parliament and the ever-growing threat of a no-deal Brexit may yet prompt a no-confidence vote. In the event such a vote attains a majority, a general election would be triggered and could be held before October 31 if the at least six-week election period is launched by mid-September.

Background

With the activation of Article 50 to leave the EU made by former Prime Minister Theresa May in 2017, the default under UK law is to leave the EU, barring an agreement being reached or some other step such as an extension or cancellation of the planned withdrawal is made. Johnson became prime minister on July 24 and has insisted on the UK leaving the EU on October 31, with or without a deal. The first Brexit deadline had been March 29, 2019, but within a week before the deadline, a major march in favor of a second referendum was held in central London. At least hundreds of thousands joined the peaceful demonstration, with organizers claiming more than one million participants packing the streets between Park Lane and Parliament Square.

A brief deadline delay was approved by the EU to shift the deadline to April 12 as the first deadline had neared. However, the failure of any agreement to be passed in Westminster and parliament unable to reach a majority on an array of Brexit-related motions resulted in further negotiations with the EU for an extension, as May sought to avoid taking the UK out of the EU without a deal. While preferences over the length of another delay were mixed amongst European leaders, an extension to October 31 was granted.Assessment

As the developments related to the Brexit crisis proceed into autumn, protests around the UK are expected to occur primarily in spurts of activity through the current scheduled Brexit day of October 31. Additional demonstrations would develop in the event of a no-deal Brexit, as well as should a major variation occur to the general aim of leaving the EU with an agreement, such as a general election or second referendum. Any delay to Brexit would be met by pro-Brexit protests, though such demonstrations have not reached the March 2019 protest in London for a second referendum. Though most Brexit-related protests have been conducted without serious incident, as tensions rise, there is a risk of confrontations and clashes between opposing groups and with authorities. Large and/or unruly protests could cause substantial disruptions in city centers, and even smaller groups of protesters may seek to cause disruption to garner greater attention to their messages. Attacks and other forms of violence or intimidation over Brexit-related positions are possible, including but not necessarily limited to the targeting of politicians.

In addition to the anticipated elevated volume of protest activity in the coming months, the prospect of a no-deal Brexit is widely seen to be increasing, though not necessarily yet the likely outcome. Nonetheless, the risks of a no-deal Brexit remain serious, with disruptions and delays highly likely at border checkpoints for both travelers and goods. Disruptions to the movement of goods and a tariff system potentially based on the World Trade Organization would likely cause substantial supply chain disruptions. Vacant warehouse space has been sparse around the UK as companies and the government have sought to stockpile key goods to mitigate the extent of shortages and other disruptions. The variety and volume of key items such as food and medicines could be hit, though fuel shortages are not considered likely at this time. A no-deal Brexit could return a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and raise the risk of paramilitary violence particularly in Northern Ireland. The government has warned that it would eliminate free movement for EU citizens in the event of a no-deal Brexit; while that could mean tighter controls for UK entry by EU citizens, it is broadly believed that the government currently lacks the capacity and information to enforce immediately any corresponding restrictions upon EU citizens already within the UK by October 31. A no-deal Brexit would also exacerbate volatility in financial markets and business sectors overall, in addition to a weakening of the Pound Sterling.

Given the array of potential impacts, Resilience360 customers are advised to continue closely monitoring ongoing developments in the Brexit process. Caution should be exercised in proximity to all protest activity, and when possible, it is advised to avoid the vicinity of demonstrations. In the event of an overall elevation of restive activity in the run-up to October 31 with an ongoing risk of leaving without a deal, the public presence of authorities may be bolstered, though police staffing levels continue to be strained. Should a general election, referendum, or another manner of public vote be held, campaign events are likely to draw protest activity as well, particularly around high-profile figures. In addition to mitigating potential risks from protest activity, any threats as well as suspicious behavior or items should be reported to local authorities.",prime minister boris johnson said

"Several hundred protesters in the Gwagwalada Area Council of Abuja, Federal Capital Territory (FCT), raided a government warehouse on 26 October, stealing medicines, bags of rice, and other food items. Similar looting incidents have been reported in several Nigerian cities including Lagos and Jos, with thousands of protestors breaking into government-owned food warehouses.A photograph taken on 26 October 2020 shows burnt buses at the deserted Ojodu Berger bus terminal during a protest against police brutality, Lagos, Nigeria.Source: Pius Utomi Ekpei/AFP via Getty Images: 1229296497Youth-led protests in support of the #EndSARS campaign to end perceived police brutality are likely to continue in the one-month outlook in Nigeria's main states and cities: Lagos, Abuja, Edo, Ekiti, Abia, Plateau, Osun, and Ondo. The latest round of demonstrations targeting the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) began in early October and have spread rapidly, largely assisted by social media campaigns by prominent, non-partisan influencers (see Nigeria: 21 October 2020: Nigerian police reform protests likely to continue and include fatalities despite Lagos shootings and imposition of curfews). Protestors have deliberately selected sites to disrupt key transport corridors in the economic and federal capitals – Lagos and Abuja, respectively. Other government sites associated with related grievances have also been targeted during the unrest and subjected to vandalism, including correctional facilities in Edo, Ondo, and Lagos in Delta state, properties associated with Lagosian state officials including the State Assembly, and Lekki toll gate, as well as the Central Bank of Nigeria in Abuja. Nationwide protests have persisted despite President Muhammadu Buhari having announced that the SARS group would be dismantled and that he was setting up several public inquiries. However, the frequency and size of protests have gradually receded after the imposition of curfews across several states and the launch of the military’s “Crocodile Smile IV” exercise (20 October–31 December) across the country, with a strong cyber-security focus to target “subversive elements”. Although stringent security measures appear to have de-escalated the protests, demonstrations are likely to escalate again once restrictions are eased, especially if the various state-wide panels of inquiry are deemed to be biased. Government and aligned forces are likely to respond in a heavy-handed manner to any further attempted gatherings in Lagos and Abuja and other hotspots such as Benin City and Port Harcourt, resulting in a high likelihood of violent confrontations as well as vandalism of buildings, vehicles, and nearby commercial property. Security forces are likely to deploy tear gas, live bullets, water cannon, and rubber bullets against protesters. Protests are also likely to resume once any restrictions are eased and are likely to escalate if the federal government fails, through the public inquiries, to prosecute indicted officers responsible for killing unarmed protestors. A total of 24 out of 36 states – including Lagos, Edo, Ondo, Katsina, Enugu, and Akwa Ibom – have inaugurated a panel of inquiry. In Lagos, hearings into alleged shootings of unarmed civilians at the Lekki toll gate on 20 October and other incidents are due to commence on 27, 30, and 31 October. However, at least nine northern governors have yet to comply, maintaining stronger sympathies for the Buhari administration and, in a few cases, for the SARS as well. Criminal gangs, especially in southern and eastern Nigeria, are likely to continue to exploit security forces’ distraction with protests to target retail centres and other service-related facilities. IHS Markit sources based in Lagos indicate that these gangs fund themselves through robberies and internet fraud but are also funded by politicians. Such gangs include the Black Axe confraternity, Eiye confraternity, Deybam, Icelanders, Mafia, and the Vikings. As the violent protests intensified, police were redeployed to manage unrest, creating a security vacuum that emboldened criminal gangs and unidentified persons to forcibly invade shopping centres, vandalise buildings, and steal household items such as furniture, electronics goods, and food. Sources indicate that daily wage labourers residing in informal settlements in close proximity to these shopping centres in Lekki Scheme I and II areas were among the attackers, highlighting the erosion of livelihoods due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus-related shocks and shutdowns. The National Bureau of Statistics reported in the second quarter that the unemployment and underemployment rate combined had risen to 55.7%. Malls, shopping centres, and private businesses, especially in areas such as Lekki Phase 1, Mushin, Yaba, Surulere, and Ikeja, are likely to be targeted for theft and looting, including cargo attacks. High-profile shops in these locales include those of South African retailers Shoprite and Game.The federal government's ostensive acceptance of protestors’ demands is likely to embolden other groups such as the Reformed Niger Delta Avengers group to issue their demands, while also encouraging inter-ethnic violence. In support of #EndSARS protests and wider grievances around rising inequality, the Reformed Niger Delta Avengers (RNDA), alongside several other Niger Delta militant groups, on 25 October issued threats to engage security forces part of Operation Crocodile Smile and resume attacks on some identified oil facilities – including the Escravos-Lagos pipeline, the Forcados pipeline and terminal, and the Bonny-Nembe Creek Trunk Line (NCTL). In late October, prominent Niger Deltan militant leader Government Ekpemupolo (Tompolo) resurfaced in a video after six years in hiding, lending credence to RNDA threats. Additionally, many governors and other prominent figures in northern Nigeria have condemned the #EndSARS protests as an attempt to forcibly remove President Buhari, with accompanying rhetoric that had already inflamed longstanding inter-ethnic disputes. A former presidential aspirant, Adamu Garba, released a recording in the Hausa language, asking northern youths to stand united and support President Buhari. Such incisive rhetoric is likely to fuel inter-ethnic violence in places such as Lagos, Port Harcourt, and Kano when any curfews, security force deployments, and restrictions on movement are eased.Major highways blockaded by #EndSARS protesters across NigeriaHighwayLocationRemarksLagos-Ibadan ExpresswayLagosSouthern NigeriaNiger Bridge, Onitsha-Asaba HighwayOnitshaSouthern NigeriaAirport Road, AbujaAbujaCentral NigeriaAirport Road, IkejaLagosSouthern NigeriaLekki &amp; Chevron toll gates, Lekki-Epe ExpresswayLagosSouthern NigeriaLagos-Badagry ExpresswayLagos StateSouthern NigeriaGbagada-Oworonshoki ExpresswayLagos StateSouthern NigeriaBenin-Lagos RoadBenin, Edo StateSouthern NigeriaOlaiya Junction, Gbongan-Ibadan HighwayOsun StateSouthern NigeriaSource: IHS Markit, based on media reports© 2020 IHS MarkitIndicators of changing risk environmentIncreasing riskCalls for more protests by prominent influencers, such as popular Christian clerics Enoch Adeboye and Sam Adeyemi, as well as activists including Aisha Yesufu, Folarin Falana, and Feyikemi Abudu.If judicial panels of inquiry are seen to be deliberately stalling proceedings or rule in favour of security forces.Decreasing riskA prompt government response to other demands from #EndSARS protestors.

"On Monday, sources reported that pirates kidnapped four crewmembers from a product tanker off the coast of Togo. According to monitors, pirates boarded the Agisilaos chemical tanker on the evening of Sunday, November 29, approximately 72 nautical miles southwest of Lome. The pirates seized four of the 23 crewmembers, including two Filipinos, one Romanian, and one Russian, before fleeing. The vessel then proceeded to anchorage at Lome and no further details were immediately provided.



Assessment: Sunday’s kidnapping was the 24th in the Gulf of Guinea – which spans some 3,500 miles from the coast of Senegal to Angola – so far this year and brings the total number of sailors kidnapped in the area to at least 122. It was also the 11th kidnapping in the area in November alone, potentially signaling worsening conditions in the area over the coming months. Pirates have historically ramped up their activities in the Gulf of Guinea between November and March, when the dry season brings calmer seas, and the recent surge in attacks could suggest that the threat from piracy is likely to remain particularly high over the coming months. Due to the high threat from pirates, all nonessential travel in the Gulf of Guinea should be avoided. Those continuing to operate in the area are urged to exercise a high level of vigilance at all times and ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to deter potential attackers.","monday source reported pirate kidnapped four crewmembers product tanker coast togo according monitor pirate boarded agisilaos chemical tanker evening sunday november 29 approximately 72 nautical mile southwest lome pirate seized four 23 crewmembers including two filipino one romanian one russian fleeing vessel proceeded anchorage lome detail immediately provided assessment sunday ’ kidnapping 24th gulf guinea – span 3,500 mile coast senegal angola – far year brings total number sailor kidnapped area least 122. also 11th kidnapping area november alone potentially signaling worsening condition area coming month pirate historically ramped activity gulf guinea november march dry season brings calmer sea recent surge attack could suggest threat piracy likely remain particularly high coming month due high threat pirate nonessential travel gulf guinea avoided continuing operate area urged exercise high level vigilance time ensure appropriate security measure place deter potential attacker","Kidnap / Detention, Maritime Advisory",Terrorism

Rainfall flooded refugee camps near the Turkish-Syrian border, including the Cordoba camp near Batabu town. Ports on the Syrian coast had been closed due to the inclement weather, and high waves caused damage to the seaside road in the coastal city of Tartous. Rains and snowfall in Lebanon cut off major mountain roads, including the highway that links Beirut with Damascus, and schools were closed in the country on Wednesday. Two deaths were reported in Lebanon as well, as a girl was swept away in southern Zahrani and another person was killed in a vehicle accident said to be cause by poor visibility. In Gaza and Egypt, strong winds caused dust storms on Wednesday, disrupting air travel and closing several Egyptian ports, all of which later reopened. In Israel, snow in Jerusalem was the first in several years. Areas in the Golan Heights and northern Galilee also experienced snowfall. Authorities shut Route 60, the main north-south highway between Jerusalem and the Etzion Bloc, and Ovda Airport (VDA) in southern Israel canceled all incoming and outgoing flights on Wednesday evening.

"Over the weekend, media sources reported that criminals affiliated with the Gulf Cartel purportedly distributed food throughout low-income neighborhoods in Ciudad Victoria, in the northeastern state of Tamaulipas. Images have circulated on social media in recent days, depicting truckloads of food crates with the cartel’s name emblazoned on the side. As of this writing, Mexican authorities have not yet commented on the veracity of the reports. 



Assessment: Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, it was not uncommon for some large cartels in Mexico to periodically engage in “charity.” Drug trafficking organizations have been known to distribute food to low-income families around the holidays, and to occasionally fund the construction of soccer fields in poor neighborhoods. However, such actions typically have an ulterior motive, serving a “public relations” function for the group. Residents of beneficiary neighborhoods might be less willing to provide information to police or to testify after witnessing crimes. Such individuals could also prove to be more amenable to collaborating with or joining the gang.



Criminal organizations throughout Mexico could potentially seek to capitalize upon the unique circumstances brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Other gangs might similarly attempt to expand their influence by shoring up support among communities that are struggling financially. However, there could also potentially be an expansion of crime in the coming weeks or months. Cargo theft, which is already rampant throughout much of the country, will likely become more lucrative. Food and other basic consumer goods might fetch higher prices as panic buying fuels scarcity. Criminals might also attempt to scale-up telephone scams and “virtual kidnappings,” as income derived from traditional sources such as extorting small businesses might dry up as more and more close. Additionally, although there have been no reports of such incidents in Mexico yet, in other parts of Latin America criminals have disguised themselves as public health officials going door to door to offer COVID-19 testing. In reality, the ruse has been used to gain access to victims’ homes.",weekend medium source reported criminal affiliated gulf cartel purportedly distributed food throughout low-income neighborhood ciudad victoria northeastern state tamaulipas image circulated social medium recent day depicting truckloads food crate cartel ’ name emblazoned side writing mexican authority yet commented veracity report assessment even covid-19 pandemic uncommon large cartel mexico periodically engage “ charity. ” drug trafficking organization known distribute food low-income family around holiday occasionally fund construction soccer field poor neighborhood however action typically ulterior motive serving “ public relation ” function group resident beneficiary neighborhood might le willing provide information police testify witnessing crime individual could also prove amenable collaborating joining gang criminal organization throughout mexico could potentially seek capitalize upon unique circumstance brought covid-19 pandemic gang might similarly attempt expand influence shoring support among community struggling financially however could also potentially expansion crime coming week month cargo theft already rampant throughout much country likely become lucrative food basic consumer good might fetch higher price panic buying fuel scarcity criminal might also attempt scale-up telephone scam “ virtual kidnapping ” income derived traditional source extorting small business might dry close additionally although report incident mexico yet part latin america criminal disguised public health official going door door offer covid-19 testing reality ruse used gain access victim ’ home,"Public Safety / Security, Public Health Advisory",Terrorism

"Authorities on Wednesday announced several measures relaxing travel restrictions to or from Hong Kong for some regions. Beginning on November 22, Hong Kong and Singapore will introduce an Air Travel Bubble (ATB) allowing quarantine-free travel for a limited number of people. The scheme will launch with one flight into each city per day, with the number of passengers capped at 200 per flight. On December 7, the number of daily flights to each city will increase to two, and the number may be increased further in the future. Travelers must not have been out of Hong Kong or Singapore in the past 14 days and must take a COVID-19 test within 72 hours before departure. Those arriving in Hong Kong from Singapore must take another test upon arrival, while travelers to Singapore must download the country’s TraceTogether COVID-19 contact tracing app. A spike in unlinked infections in either Hong Kong or Singapore will result in the system being suspended for at least two weeks.



Starting November 23, Hong Kong residents returning from mainland China’s Guangdong Province or Macao will not have to undergo a mandatory quarantine if they participate in Hong Kong’s Return2hk program. Participants must register their travel with the Hong Kong government beforehand and test negative for COVID-19 at an approved medical facility in Guangdong or Macao within 72 hours before arriving in Hong Kong. They must also not have been outside of Hong Kong, Guangdong, or Macao in the previous 14 days, and must submit their test results to Hong Kong’s health department before arriving at the border. The program will initially be limited to 3,000 arrivals daily at the Shenzhen Bay Port crossing and 2,000 arrivals via the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge, but these numbers may be increased. Travelers from Hong Kong to Guangdong or Macao will continue to be required to quarantine when entering those regions. Exact details for the Return2hk plan, along with links to lists of approved testing facilities and information on transmitting test results to Hong Kong authorities, are available here: https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/return2hk-scheme.html.



Assessment: Both travel schemes represent an important reopening of regional travel following COVID-19 restrictions. With the possibility for increasing the number of participating travelers in the future, there is also the potential for expanding the programs to significantly larger groups of people. They could also serve as models for additional future regional travel bubbles. In addition to being an important step toward the reopening of regional air travel, the Hong Kong-Singapore ATB should be a significant first move toward re-establishing operations for air carriers based in Hong Kong and Singapore, which have been especially hard-hit by travel restrictions since they have no domestic markets to fall back on. COVID-19 is currently under control in Guangdong, Hong Kong, Macao, and Singapore, which has allowed the travel arrangements to be implemented. There remains the potential, though, for spikes in COVID-19 infections to lead to the suspension or alteration of the new programs, and potential travelers are advised to follow virus developments.","authority wednesday announced several measure relaxing travel restriction hong kong region beginning november 22 hong kong singapore introduce air travel bubble atb allowing quarantine-free travel limited number people scheme launch one flight city per day number passenger capped 200 per flight december 7 number daily flight city increase two number may increased future traveler must hong kong singapore past 14 day must take covid-19 test within 72 hour departure arriving hong kong singapore must take another test upon arrival traveler singapore must download country ’ tracetogether covid-19 contact tracing app spike unlinked infection either hong kong singapore result system suspended least two week starting november 23 hong kong resident returning mainland china ’ guangdong province macao undergo mandatory quarantine participate hong kong ’ return2hk program participant must register travel hong kong government beforehand test negative covid-19 approved medical facility guangdong macao within 72 hour arriving hong kong must also outside hong kong guangdong macao previous 14 day must submit test result hong kong ’ health department arriving border program initially limited 3,000 arrival daily shenzhen bay port crossing 2,000 arrival via hong kong-zhuhai-macao bridge number may increased traveler hong kong guangdong macao continue required quarantine entering region exact detail return2hk plan along link list approved testing facility information transmitting test result hong kong authority available http //www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/return2hk-scheme.html assessment travel scheme represent important reopening regional travel following covid-19 restriction possibility increasing number participating traveler future also potential expanding program significantly larger group people could also serve model additional future regional travel bubble addition important step toward reopening regional air travel hong kong-singapore atb significant first move toward re-establishing operation air carrier based hong kong singapore especially hard-hit travel restriction since domestic market fall back covid-19 currently control guangdong hong kong macao singapore allowed travel arrangement implemented remains potential though spike covid-19 infection lead suspension alteration new program potential traveler advised follow virus development","Aviation Advisory, Ground Transportation Advisory, Public Health Advisory, Regulatory Advisory",Administrative Issue

"On Tuesday, damage assessments were ongoing in areas affected by wildfires in California. The Camp Fire in Butte County has been dubbed the deadliest and most damaging wildfire in state history. There have been 42 fire-related deaths associated with the Camp Fire, and more than 200 people are still unaccounted for. Current estimates are that 6,522 single family residences, 85 multiple family residential structures, and 260 commercial structures have been destroyed. Another 75 single family residences, 32 commercial structures, and 772 minor structures have been damaged. Approximately 15,500 structures remain threatened by the Camp Fire. 
 
	In Southern California, preliminary assessments for the area impacted by the Woolsey Fire indicate that around 435 structures have been destroyed and at least 24 others have been damaged. Another 57,000 structures are currently threatened. Two fire-related deaths have been attributed to the Woolsey Fire. The Hill Fire, which has largely been contained, destroyed two structures and damaged two others.

	Assessment: Damage assessments for the Camp and Woolsey fires have yet to be completed, and it is likely that both the number of fire-related fatalities and damaged or destroyed structures will increase. Red Flag Warnings remained in effect on Tuesday for areas of San Diego, Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside, Ventura, and Los Angeles counties. Even after winds are forecast to subside on Wednesday and Thursday, very low relative humidity and dry fuels will present conditions favorable for wildfire development and spread. Meteorologist forecast chances of rain in Northern and Southern California beginning next week; however, the exact tract and intensity of storms remains unclear. Current forecasts indicate rainfall will be more significant in Northern California than in Southern California. Businesses and residents are advised to adhere to all evacuation orders and official guidance.

“Location:   Central Mainland Provinces



Event: Typhoon Molave and Storm Season Preparedness in Vietnam



The U.S. Embassy in Hanoi and Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City alert U.S. citizens to Typhone Molave, which is expected to make landfall on Wednesday, October 28th between Da Nang and Phu Yen before weakening into a tropical depression.  The storm is expected to pack 90 mile per hour winds and could trigger prolonged flooding and extreme rainfall.  Recent storms in Vietnam have resulted in widespread flooding, landslides, and loss of life in the central region.



The typhoon season in Vietnam runs from approximately June 1 through the end of November, while the tropical cyclone season typically runs from November 1 to April 30.  If you are a U.S. Citizen traveling or residing in Vietnam, you may enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) (https://step.state.gov/step/) to receive safety messages and other travel information.  During the approach of a typhoon you should monitor the U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center (https://www.metoc.navy.mil/jtwc/jtwc.html) and the Vietnam National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting (https://kttv.gov.vn/KttvsiteE/en-US/2/index.html).



Actions to Take:



You should have an emergency plan in place before the approach of a storm. Even areas far from the coastline can experience dangerous winds, tornadoes, mudslides, and floods. Please take precautionary measures to ensure minimal disruption or damage and have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance. You should also contact friends and family in the United States with updates on your whereabouts.



Enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program step.state.gov

Locate shelter and follow all official instructions, including evacuation if ordered.

Carry your travel documents at all times (i.e., U.S. passport, birth certificate, picture ID’s, etc.) or secure them in a safe, waterproof location.

"On 12 December, Singaporean Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan urged Malaysia to withdraw its ships from what Singapore claims are its waters, adding that failure to do so would create an unnecessary risk of accidents, and would be detrimental to bilateral talks scheduled for January 2019. Malaysia's Foreign Ministry had earlier rejected a Singaporean government proposal for withdrawal of both countries' coastguard vessels from disputed maritime territory around Johor Bahru port, but agreed to hold bilateral talks in January 2019. Both sides have increasingly reported alleged territorial waters incursions since Malaysia's unilateral extension of the port's limits into waters claimed by Singapore off Tuas in October 2018. These developments are the latest in a growing number of bilateral territorial disputes since Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad assumed power in Malaysia in May 2018.The Malaysian government's rejection of Singapore's offer of a return to the pre-October 2018 status quo indicates Mahathir's intent to maintain a confrontational policy towards Singapore. This is driven by domestic Malaysian politics, where Mahathir leads a diverse governing coalition and has historically used disputes with Singapore to strengthen his domestic standing. Military confrontation remains unlikely and even accidental escalation is a low risk; both the Malaysian and Singaporean navies held joint military exercises as recently as 3 December, indicating strong bilateral communication and co-ordination. At most, there is an increased risk of Malaysian and Singaporean coast guards seizing commercial shipping accused of incurring into disputed waters off Tuas. However, the location of the disputed waters adjacent to, but not on, the Singapore Strait limits the impact of this risk on Singapore's busiest shipping lanes. An indicator of increasing war risk would be if Singapore persists with its intent to use a reportedly small portion of Malaysian airspace near Johor for access to its second civilian airport, Seletar. The Singaporean government agreeing in the planned January talks to negotiate water sharing and/or the aviation airspace disputes would be an indicator of reduced risk.

"Health Minister Zweli Mkhize announced on 9 December that South Africa was experiencing a resurgence in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus infections, driven by a rising rate of infections in the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, and Gauteng provinces. On the same day, the country recorded 6,700 new cases, a sharp increase compared with September, when daily infections averaged 1,000 cases or less. Significance: Coastal cities including Durban and Richards Bay in KwaZulu-Natal, Cape Town in Western Cape, and East London in Eastern Cape are likely to have the most restrictive lockdown measures. These are likely to include limited business operating hours, quotas on workforce presence in places of work, and, in severely affected areas, the closing down of non-essential services. These cities will be targeted due to the expected seasonal influx of holiday-makers from the interior of the country. Details of these restrictions will be decided on at a meeting between the president and the National Coronavirus Command Council before 14 December. The restrictions will probably come into effect by 15 December and will likely last at least until the end of January 2021. Land border controls will probably be stricter, with check-points erected at affected provincial border posts. This is likely to slow down ground cargo movement from coastal cities and harbours such as Durban by up to a day. Air border controls will likely remain unaffected, however, with international visitors expected to produce COVID-19 test results obtained 72 hours prior to departure.

"Monsoon rainfall and flooding, which typically lasts from June to September in South Asia, has caused numerous disruptions and been particularly widespread in parts of the region this year. In India, approximately 850 people have been killed so far in this year’s monsoon season, with millions impacted. On Wednesday, traffic was disrupted by flooding in Delhi, and the death toll from a rain-related landslide in Kerala rose to 61, with at least nine people still missing. Recent floods have been reported in such states as Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Meghalaya, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. Government flood advisories have been issued over the next several days for areas in the north of the country, including the states of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, and Uttar Pradesh, and rain and possible flooding is also forecast for Goa, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Telangana. 



In Bangladesh, more than 220 people have been killed this season. According to the government, as much as 40 percent of the country has been affected by flooding, which has occurred in at least 33 out of 64 districts and has been described as the second-worst bout of flooding Bangladesh has ever experienced. Approximately six million buildings have been damaged, and at least 40,000 people have faced evacuation. While the situation has begun to normalize to some extent in parts of the country, meteorological authorities have warned that river levels are expected to rise again this month, which may lead to additional flooding through mid-September, although any further flooding is expected to be more localized.



More than 210 people have died in flooding and landslides in Nepal this year, and at least 40,000 have been evacuated. Single landslides in the country have killed dozens of people and left dozens more missing. Most recently, a landslide in Bagmati Pradesh killed at least 24 people and damaged more than 50 buildings. As of this writing, 15 people remain missing. 



Assessment: Flood response efforts have been further complicated this year by COVID-19. Authorities have faced difficulties in maintaining social distancing measures at evacuation centers, and in some cases have had to deal with shortages of shelter for evacuees, as normal evacuation locations were being used as quarantine facilities. In some cases, too, quarantine buildings have been damaged by flooding, necessitating the relocation of quarantined individuals. The flooding in Bangladesh led to disruptions to the government’s COVID-19 testing regime, significantly lowering the number of tests being carried out and hampering virus relief efforts, even if only temporarily. It is likely that parts of India and Nepal have also seen at least some impacts to testing and other virus response efforts. 



Flooding in the region has also damaged infrastructure and led to the disruption of infrastructure projects. In Bangladesh, construction of a railway between the southern cities of Khulna and Mongla has been delayed until at least next summer after the initial June completion deadline was missed due to both flooding and COVID-19. Roads and bridges have been damaged across the region. Agriculture has faced substantial losses in flood-affected areas. In some parts of India, dam reservoirs are over 85 percent full, with some at up to 97 percent capacity. Such water levels lead to the possibility of further downstream flooding if dams overflow, if floodgates have to be opened to relieve pressure, or if dams potentially fail. The flood situation also has the potential to negatively affect relations between countries in the region. Nepal in the past has blamed Indian construction projects for increased flooding in its border areas, and this season some Indian officials in border states have accused Nepali authorities of not cooperating on flood-mitigation projects. Those with interests in the region are advised of the likelihood of continuing disruptions in areas affected by flooding or heavy rain, and of the potential for additional flooding before the conclusion of the monsoon season.","monsoon rainfall flooding typically last june september south asia caused numerous disruption particularly widespread part region year india approximately 850 people killed far year ’ monsoon season million impacted wednesday traffic disrupted flooding delhi death toll rain-related landslide kerala rose 61 least nine people still missing recent flood reported state andhra pradesh assam bihar arunachal pradesh gujarat karnataka meghalaya rajasthan uttar pradesh government flood advisory issued next several day area north country including state haryana himachal pradesh punjab uttarakhand uttar pradesh rain possible flooding also forecast goa madhya pradesh maharashtra rajasthan telangana bangladesh 220 people killed season according government much 40 percent country affected flooding occurred least 33 64 district described second-worst bout flooding bangladesh ever experienced approximately six million building damaged least 40,000 people faced evacuation situation begun normalize extent part country meteorological authority warned river level expected rise month may lead additional flooding mid-september although flooding expected localized 210 people died flooding landslide nepal year least 40,000 evacuated single landslide country killed dozen people left dozen missing recently landslide bagmati pradesh killed least 24 people damaged 50 building writing 15 people remain missing assessment flood response effort complicated year covid-19 authority faced difficulty maintaining social distancing measure evacuation center case deal shortage shelter evacuee normal evacuation location used quarantine facility case quarantine building damaged flooding necessitating relocation quarantined individual flooding bangladesh led disruption government ’ covid-19 testing regime significantly lowering number test carried hampering virus relief effort even temporarily likely part india nepal also seen least impact testing virus response effort flooding region also damaged infrastructure led disruption infrastructure project bangladesh construction railway southern city khulna mongla delayed least next summer initial june completion deadline missed due flooding covid-19 road bridge damaged across region agriculture faced substantial loss flood-affected area part india dam reservoir 85 percent full 97 percent capacity water level lead possibility downstream flooding dam overflow floodgate opened relieve pressure dam potentially fail flood situation also potential negatively affect relation country region nepal past blamed indian construction project increased flooding border area season indian official border state accused nepali authority cooperating flood-mitigation project interest region advised likelihood continuing disruption area affected flooding heavy rain potential additional flooding conclusion monsoon season","Regulatory Advisory, Political Info / Event, Ground Transportation Advisory, Public Health Advisory, Network Disruption, Weather Advisory",Administrative Issue

"Regional media sources report that parts of 20 major cities in Pakistan were placed under a “smart lockdown” on Tuesday as part of the government’s efforts to curb the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Affected locations include Karachi, Lahore, Quetta, Peshawar, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Faisalabad, Multan, Gujranawala, Swat, Hyderabad, Sukkar, Sialkot, Gujarat, Ghotki, Larakana, Khairpur, Dera Ghazi Khan, Malakand, and Mardan, all of which were identified as COVID-19 “hotspots” during a comprehensive review by the country’s National Command and Operation Center (NCOC) on June 15. Access and egress from neighborhoods under lockdown have been cut off, and police have been deployed to enforce the closure of markets and other non-essential businesses outside the hours of 9:00 AM and 7:00 PM local time Saturday to Thursday, except for grocery stores and medical stores. Additionally, gatherings of ten or more people are banned and it is mandatory for people to wear face masks in public. The lockdown measures will reportedly remain in place for at least two weeks (June 30). According to the NCOC, areas designated as “hotspots” are witnessing an increase in COVID-19 transmission, such as Islamabad’s G-9/2 and G-9/3 areas, which have recorded over 300 cases alone in recent days. As of Wednesday, Pakistan’s coronavirus case tally stood at 154,760 confirmed infections and 2,975 deaths attributed to the virus.



Assessment: Although cases have decreased in recent days after Pakistan reported new high daily incidence for five consecutive days from June 9-13, including its current record of 6,825 on June 13, the country’s coronavirus curve continues to show a constant upward trajectory, with sizeable jumps recorded each day. This trend has been attributed to what was widely perceived as the government’s premature lifting of lockdown measures last month; however, Prime Minister Imran Khan has insisted that the country cannot afford another comprehensive shutdown to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, dismissing recommendations for such action by the World Health Organization and similar agencies and paving the way for the current “smart lockdown” approach, which authorities claim protects people in high-risk areas while still allowing commercial activities to continue. However, it is unclear at best whether this seemingly piecemeal and ad hoc strategy will succeed in stemming the outbreak, which medical professionals now expect to peak in July or August and potentially infect up to 900,000 people. In addition to increasing exposure and deaths, such a scenario would risk straining Pakistan’s already weak healthcare system. Indeed, there have been growing reports in recent weeks that hospitals in multiple cities have exceeded their capacity to treat COVID-19 patients, while morale among medical workers is said to be in decline over shortages of equipment and fears of being physically assaulted by infected individuals and their families. The combination of these factors could be a sign of rising tensions and anxiety amongst the public, which could manifest in protests, labor strikes, and other forms of unrest if the current situation persists. It is advised to stay apprised of associated health and security developments in this regard.","regional medium source report part 20 major city pakistan placed “ smart lockdown ” tuesday part government ’ effort curb spread coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 affected location include karachi lahore quetta peshawar rawalpindi islamabad faisalabad multan gujranawala swat hyderabad sukkar sialkot gujarat ghotki larakana khairpur dera ghazi khan malakand mardan identified covid-19 “ hotspot ” comprehensive review country ’ national command operation center ncoc june 15. access egress neighborhood lockdown cut police deployed enforce closure market non-essential business outside hour 9:00 7:00 pm local time saturday thursday except grocery store medical store additionally gathering ten people banned mandatory people wear face mask public lockdown measure reportedly remain place least two week june 30 according ncoc area designated “ hotspot ” witnessing increase covid-19 transmission islamabad ’ g-9/2 g-9/3 area recorded 300 case alone recent day wednesday pakistan ’ coronavirus case tally stood 154,760 confirmed infection 2,975 death attributed virus assessment although case decreased recent day pakistan reported new high daily incidence five consecutive day june 9-13 including current record 6,825 june 13 country ’ coronavirus curve continues show constant upward trajectory sizeable jump recorded day trend attributed widely perceived government ’ premature lifting lockdown measure last month however prime minister imran khan insisted country afford another comprehensive shutdown mitigate spread covid-19 dismissing recommendation action world health organization similar agency paving way current “ smart lockdown ” approach authority claim protects people high-risk area still allowing commercial activity continue however unclear best whether seemingly piecemeal ad hoc strategy succeed stemming outbreak medical professional expect peak july august potentially infect 900,000 people addition increasing exposure death scenario would risk straining pakistan ’ already weak healthcare system indeed growing report recent week hospital multiple city exceeded capacity treat covid-19 patient morale among medical worker said decline shortage equipment fear physically assaulted infected individual family combination factor could sign rising tension anxiety amongst public could manifest protest labor strike form unrest current situation persists advised stay apprised associated health security development regard","Public Health Advisory, Ground Transportation Advisory, Security Advisory",Administrative Issue

"On 22 December, Asia Securities Industry &amp; Financial Markets Association (ASIFMA) published a report on sustainability data in the Asia-Pacific region, recommending a policy drive to establish common standards. The trade body's report, prepared jointly with the Future of Sustainable Data Alliance (FOSDA), reflected a 12-month review including online discussions involving 500 participants.  It suggests that East Asia is lagging behind global environmental, social and governance (ESG) development with 5% of regional assets under management invested in sustainable projects versus 30% in North America. It also argues that rapid economic growth, expanding populations, industrialisation and urbanisation create large-scale need for climate-related financing. In an ASIFA poll, 56% of respondents described “inconsistent data” as the most serious data challenge to ESG development, while 35% of respondents cited “poor quality data”. The report noted that the region lacks standardised ESG measurement criteria, suggesting that metrics differ between countries and sectors and within industries. OutlookASIFMA warns of growing climate risks with “Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, Japan, India and Vietnam all particularly exposed to rising sea levels and… higher credit risk”. It claims that Asian firms are “navigating a confusing landscape of disclosure frameworks, incentive structures, data collection methods, and assessment” and work without a “single binding global taxonomy”, arguing that business users want “greater harmonization” to assist ESG development.  ASIFMA made eight key policy recommendations. These include global or at least regional convergence towards a principles-based taxonomy, higher and more consistent corporate disclosure standards, encouragement of stronger analysis, policies and regulation to encourage development of ESG/sustainable financing capabilities, and a focus on ESG development through education. Favouring partnership between the private and public sectors, it also calls for harmonised ratings procedures, potentially supported by regulatory intervention, and increased alignment of bank regulation and supervision with global ESG standards. Overall, during 2020 ASIFMA noted moves in mainland China, Hong Kong SAR and Singapore to “scale green and sustainable finance markets”, together with the adoption of ESG criteria by Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund and MUFG as risk-positive: wider regional policy and regulatory initiatives would be a key indicator for climate-related financial progress.  &copy; 2020, IHS Markit Inc.

An unspecified number of refugees were taken to a central processing point from which 11 buses departed on Thursday for the city of Chittagong. From there, they will be transported by boat to the island. Between 1,000 and 3,000 refugees are expected to be moved initially, with the government aiming to relocate up to 100,000 people between now and April while the weather is typically calmer for boat travel in the region.



Assessment: Government officials have denied that any Rohingya will be forced to relocate to Bhasan Char; however, activists have alleged that some refugees are being moved against their will, while others have been offered financial incentives to transfer to the island. Critics have also warned that the island is flood-prone and that its location leaves it exposed to potential cyclones. Approximately 300 Rohingya are already residing on the island after having been rescued at sea earlier this year. There have been allegations that they have faced abuse from security forces while living on Bhasan Char. Crime is widespread in the refugee camps near Cox’s Bazar, and additional military and police personnel were dispatched to the camps in October due to clashes related to an organized crime dispute. It is possible that unrest could develop in the camps if residents are being forced to relocate, and there is also the potential for similar disruptions at embarkation points for refugees in Chittagong. More than 700,000 refugees have been living in camps near Cox’s Bazar following a 2017 crackdown against the minority group by the Myanmar military. It is advised to remain abreast of security developments and to generally avoid nonessential travel to the Cox’s Bazar area.","bangladeshi government wednesday night began process relocating rohingya refugee southern camp near cox ’ bazar island bhasan char located 20 mile coast chittagong bay bengal unspecified number refugee taken central processing point 11 bus departed thursday city chittagong transported boat island 1,000 3,000 refugee expected moved initially government aiming relocate 100,000 people april weather typically calmer boat travel region assessment government official denied rohingya forced relocate bhasan char however activist alleged refugee moved others offered financial incentive transfer island critic also warned island flood-prone location leaf exposed potential cyclone approximately 300 rohingya already residing island rescued sea earlier year allegation faced abuse security force living bhasan char crime widespread refugee camp near cox ’ bazar additional military police personnel dispatched camp october due clash related organized crime dispute possible unrest could develop camp resident forced relocate also potential similar disruption embarkation point refugee chittagong 700,000 refugee living camp near cox ’ bazar following 2017 crackdown minority group myanmar military advised remain abreast security development generally avoid nonessential travel cox ’ bazar area",Public Safety / Security,Terrorism

"From midnight on Tuesday, authorities in Hong Kong will impose what media sources have described as among the most stringent travel and social distancing restrictions since the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in January. The measures will reportedly require individuals to wear masks on public transport, cap group gatherings at four people, prohibit restaurants from providing dine-in service after 6:00 PM local time, and order shut for one week establishments seen as high-risk for spreading COVID-19, including gyms, bathhouses, arcades, and other public recreational facilities. Further, all exhibitions and public events will be canceled or postponed, while travelers arriving from high-risk areas in the past 14 days will be required to present a negative COVID-19 lab test prior to departure. Separately, the new restrictions will force the closure of Hong Kong Disneyland, which only reopened on June 18, from Wednesday, July 15, though hotels at the resort will reportedly remain open, albeit with service modifications in place. The moves come as Hong Kong is experiencing a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, with some 250 new infections having been recorded in the past week alone after several weeks of single-digit or zero increases in daily incidence and deaths. To date, Hong Kong has recorded 1,570 positive COVID-19 infections and eight deaths attributed to the virus, including 48 new cases on Tuesday that local health authorities said had unknown sources.



Assessment: Hong Kong’s reinstatement of coronavirus restrictions highlights the balance that governments around the world are trying to strike between protecting public health and allowing economic and social activities to continue. That said, the strict nature of the containment measures, notably those pertaining to face mask use aboard public transport and dine-in service at restaurants, neither of which were adopted in the previous stages of Hong Kong’s COVID-19 outbreak, signal concern on the part of the government over the potential for a large-scale outbreak. The public should stay apprised of associated health developments in this regard and prepare for the possibility of additional restrictions on other business and social activities if the rise in cases does not abate. When coupled with the uncertainty surrounding the operating environment in Hong Kong following the passage of the National Security Law on June 30, one may consider deferring travel to Hong Kong until the situation stabilizes.","midnight tuesday authority hong kong impose medium source described among stringent travel social distancing restriction since start coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic january measure reportedly require individual wear mask public transport cap group gathering four people prohibit restaurant providing dine-in service 6:00 pm local time order shut one week establishment seen high-risk spreading covid-19 including gym bathhouse arcade public recreational facility exhibition public event canceled postponed traveler arriving high-risk area past 14 day required present negative covid-19 lab test prior departure separately new restriction force closure hong kong disneyland reopened june 18 wednesday july 15 though hotel resort reportedly remain open albeit service modification place move come hong kong experiencing resurgence covid-19 case 250 new infection recorded past week alone several week single-digit zero increase daily incidence death date hong kong recorded 1,570 positive covid-19 infection eight death attributed virus including 48 new case tuesday local health authority said unknown source assessment hong kong ’ reinstatement coronavirus restriction highlight balance government around world trying strike protecting public health allowing economic social activity continue said strict nature containment measure notably pertaining face mask use aboard public transport dine-in service restaurant neither adopted previous stage hong kong ’ covid-19 outbreak signal concern part government potential large-scale outbreak public stay apprised associated health development regard prepare possibility additional restriction business social activity rise case abate coupled uncertainty surrounding operating environment hong kong following passage national security law june 30 one may consider deferring travel hong kong situation stabilizes","Public Health Advisory, Ground Transportation Advisory, Security Advisory",Administrative Issue

This suggests that 20–30 million doses of Covishield will be directed towards the private sector prior to the Indian government’s need for vaccines being met. This increases the chances of a secondary market for vaccines where people unable to access vaccines locally or from other countries could pay to purchase the vaccine, potentially delaying access to those most in need globally. With vaccine supplies not meeting demand, corruption and the emergence of a black market are also a possibility.Update on COVID-19 infectionsTotal confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) globally had reached 67,143,905 at the time of writing on 7 December, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, compared with 65,235,456 on 4 December. The number of cases in the US, the country with the largest number of confirmed cases, rose to 14,761,577 compared with 14,143,801 on 4 December. Confirmed case numbers in India, the country with the second-highest confirmed case numbers, reached 9,677,203 compared with 9,571,559 on 4 December. India was followed by Brazil, with 6,603,540 cases (compared with 6,487,084 on 4 December), Russia (2,466,961 cases), and France (2,345,648 cases).Total deaths worldwide reported as resulting from COVID-19 had reached 1,537,260 at the time of writing, compared with 1,506,601 on the previous day. The number of deaths in the US, which is the highest of any country globally, had reached 282,324 compared with 276,366 on 4 December. In terms of fatality numbers, the US was followed by Brazil (176,941, up from 175,270 on 4 December), India (140,573), Mexico (109,717), and the United Kingdom (61,342).France: Local media sources have reported the head of infectious diseases at Paris hospital La Pitié-Salpêtrière as saying that the current modelling shows that the downtrend in the number of new COVID-19 infections may have plateaued. Based on current projections, the rate of new infections is unlikely to fall below the government’s target of less than 5,000 cases per day by 15 December. The target has been declared a prerequisite for easing certain restrictions from mid-December. The findings have increased concerns among policy-makers and healthcare authorities that the country should be bracing for a further “third wave” of new infection cases from around mid-January 2021 onwards. The latest data reveal that France reported 11,022 new COVID-19 cases on 6 December 2020. Vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics development updateVaccinesBahrain: Bahrain granted emergency use authorisation (EUA) for Pfizer (US) and BioNTech (Germany)’s COVID-19 vaccine on 4 December, according to the country’s National Health Regulatory Authority (NHRA). Bahrain has become the second country after the UK to approve the vaccine, and this follows Bahrain’s approval of Sinopharm (China)’s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use in frontline workers. According to CEO of Bahrain’s NHRA Mariam Al-Jalahma, “The approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine will add a further important layer to the Kingdom’s [referring to Bahrain] national COVID-19 response.” The vaccine will be prioritised to high-risk groups, including the elderly, those with chronic diseases, and other vulnerable people identified by the health ministry. As cited in Arab News, head of Pfizer in the Gulf Lindsey Dietschi has commended Bahrain for “its ability to conduct an accurate assessment and take action in time to help protect citizens and residents in the Kingdom”.India: Pfizer filed for emergency approval to import and distribute its COVID-19 vaccine in India on 4 December, according to health officials. Pfizer is the first pharmaceutical firm to seek emergency approval of a COVID-19 vaccine by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI). According to a Pfizer spokesperson cited by Reuters, “We remain committed to engaging with the Government of India and explore opportunities to make this vaccine available for use in the country.” Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine was granted emergency approval in Bahrain and the UK. India: The Serum Institute of India (SII) on 6 December filed for EUA in India of its domestically produced version of AstraZeneca (UK) and Oxford University’s COVID-19 vaccine, Covishield, according to SII CEO Adar Poonawalla. The SII filed for authorisation with the DCGI based on data from four clinical trials, including two in the UK, one in Brazil, and one in India, citing unmet medical need for vaccines because of the pandemic, according to Reuters. Poonawalla has stated that the vaccine “will save countless lives” and comes soon after Pfizer’s emergency submission for approval of its COVID-19 vaccine in India. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the SII has already manufactured 40 million doses of Covishield under the at-risk manufacturing and stockpiling licence that it has been granted from the DCGI. Although initial doses will be supplied to the Indian government and distributed shortly after authorisation potentially around January 2021, Poonawalla anticipates that 20–30 million doses will be sold to private facilities starting from March 2021, the Financial Times reported. The retail price for the vaccine is expected to be about INR600 (USD8.00) in the private market in India, while the “philanthropic price” for purchase by the Indian government will be USD3.00, according to the source.Turkey: Turkey’s leading domestically developed COVID-19 vaccine candidate, ERUCOV-VAC, will be advancing to Phase II human trials in weeks, according to MENAFN, citing officials. The candidate, developed by Erciyes University researchers, will conclude Phase I clinical trials in 44 participants on 14 December, with Phase II testing commencing two days later, according to the source. About 200 volunteers will be enrolled in the Phase II study, with more than 100 volunteer applications already received by the university research centre. Since the human trials for ERUCOV-VAC began in November, no serious side effects have been reported, according to the source. Ahmet Inal, deputy director of the university’s research centre, called on the public to “break their prejudice” against vaccinations and volunteer to participate in the trial. Inal added, “The higher the number of inoculations, the higher the immunity among people will be.” Turkey has already received a shipment of the Chinese COVID-19 vaccine developed by Sinovac, CoronaVac, to help tackle the pandemic, with mass vaccination of the population anticipated to begin 11 December, prioritising healthcare workers and senior citizens. Inal stated that they expect the vaccine to provide immunity for 6–8 months, which would require millions of doses (328 million if immunity lasts six months), highlighting the need for domestic production of COVID-19 vaccines to help meet this large demand and address concerns regarding safety that are often tied to imported vaccines.TreatmentsUnited States: Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania are collaborating with Regeneron (US) to investigate intranasal administration of Regeneron’s COVID-19 antibody cocktail treatment – casirivimab and imdevimab – via adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. The research collaboration, led by the laboratory of gene therapy pioneer and professor of medicine James Wilson, will assess the safety and efficacy of using AAV vectors to introduce a sequence of the neutralising antibodies directly to nasal epithelial cells. The use of gene therapy in this setting could help achieve a sustained expression of antibodies in the nasal mucosa, the site of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a single administration. The AAV genome that codes for the antibody remains stable in the nucleus of transduced cells, according to a statement from the university, although there were no details on how long antibody production will be sustained by the nasal epithelial cells. The first stage of the research will include validations of the effectiveness of antibodies delivered via AAV in animal challenge trials; if successful, the team will complete studies required for an investigational new drug (IND) application with the US FDA, required to begin clinical testing. Unlike vaccines, the gene therapy would elicit immediate antibody development without the need for an immune system response. This might be particularly useful in individuals with weakened immune systems, including the elderly.United States: Eli Lilly (US) and UnitedHealth (US) have announced a partnership to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bamlanivimab versus a propensity-matched control in UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage members who meet the EUA criteria for the antibody – patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 or hospitalisation. The “pragmatic” study will leverage UnitedHealth’s health benefit and Optum health businesses for daily symptom tracking via an app, self-administered in-home SARS-CoV-2 testing, as well as in-home infusion services to identify and treat a large and diverse population of COVID-19 in patients ahead of hospitalisation under real world conditions. The innovative design of the trial allows patients to remain quarantined and minimises further spread of the disease, while reducing the burden on hospitals. The trial will enrol up to 500,000 people, with at least 5,000 anticipated to receive bamlanivimab, according to Eli Lilly.DiagnosticsUnited States: The US FDA has approved Quest Diagnostics (US)’ COVID-19 + Flu RT-PCR Test, the first diagnostic test for at-home collection of samples to detect COVID-19 and influenza A and B to garner an EUA in the US. The test can be provided to patients under a healthcare provider’s order to perform at-home sample collection, and subsequently shipped to a Quest Diagnostics laboratory for analysis. According to FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, the tests can provide answers to patients and their healthcare providers in an expedited manner, and “this efficiency can go a long way to providing timely information for those sick with an unknown respiratory ailment”.Other developmentsAustralia – Canada – Singapore – Switzerland – United Kingdom: Pharmaceutical regulators in Australia, Canada, Singapore, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom – under the umbrella of the Access Consortium organisation – issued a joint statement on 4 December discussing the regulatory evidence requirement for COVID-19 vaccine approvals and post-market pharmacovigilance. The statement essentially repeats a previous pledge to co-operate in the area of COVID-19 vaccines regulation that was issued in May 2020, but this has been expanded to include the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) as the Access Consortium’s newest member. Canada: The Canadian government has doubled its advanced purchase agreement (APA) order for Moderna (US)’s mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Canadian Minister of Procurement Anita Anand announced on 4 December that the government plans to purchase an additional 20 million doses. This will take the total APA order for mRNA-1273 to 40 million doses to be supplied in 2021. IHS Markit’s COVID-19 vaccines APAs tracker previously recorded that Canadian authorities had ordered 20 million doses of mRNA-1273 (with option to expand to 56 million). A rolling regulatory submission for mRNA-1273 was started in mid-October 2020 (see World: 15 October 2020: Daily COVID-19 roundup: Moderna announces initiation of rolling submission to Health Canada for mRNA-1273, vaccine supply capacity for LMICs ramps up). The approval decision is expected in January 2021. China: Sinovac Biotech (mainland China) has reported that the company has secured USD515 million in additional funding from the Hong Kong SAR-based generics company Sino Biopharmaceutical. The cash injection will see Sino Biopharmaceutical acquire a 15% in Sinovac Life Sciences, a subsidiary of Sinovac Biotech. The new funding is intended to allow Sinovac to double manufacturing capacity for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, CoronaVac, and prepare global distribution supply lines, primarily in the Asian region, but also in Brazil and Turkey, among other countries. Efficacy data for the COVID-19 candidate are due to be published later in December, according to IHS Markit’s weekly R&amp;D tracker. The Chinese company anticipates that manufacturing capacity will potentially reach 300 million doses of the vaccine per year, after the construction of a second manufacturing facility is completed by late 2020.France: Members of the French government’s vaccine steering committee have provided further details of the planned strategy for the deployment and administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Acknowledging the high levels of vaccine scepticism that exist in France, committee member Alain Fischer said on 6 December that healthcare authorities would proceed cautiously. The plans currently on the table call for the vaccination campaign to launch in nursing homes from 1 January 2021. Global: Pfizer and BioNTech are reportedly in closing stages of negotiations with the World Health Organization (WHO) to join the COVAX alliance for the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines globally. WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan has reportedly said that “discussions are going on with Pfizer and it should be finalised in two days”. Details regarding the number of potential doses of Pfizer/BioNTech’s BNT162b2 that could be secured for the COVAX Facility and the pricing arrangements are not available at the time of writing. The purpose of COVAX is to secure about 20% of a signatory country’s vaccine supply requirements over the long term, with the WHO setting a target for 2 billion doses to be delivered internationally by the end of 2021. The initiative is co-led by an international vaccine alliance known as Gavi and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). A total of 180 countries have signed up, including low- and medium-income countries as well as well-resourced nations such as Canada and the UK. Global: WHO representatives have confirmed that the agency anticipates receiving 500 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines for distribution via the COVAX initiative during the first quarter of 2021. WHO chief scientist Swaminathan has reportedly said, “Countries can start expecting doses toward the end of the first quarter of 2021. A few countries may start earlier, it's likely, possible, that we may have some learnings by going early into a few countries.” Indonesia: Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto has issued a decree on potential EUAs of COVID-19 vaccine candidates under development, including AstaZeneca’s AZD1222 (ChAdOx1-S), Pfizer/BioNTech’s BNT162b2, Sinopharm’s candidates, Sinovac Biotech’s CoronaVac, and Moderna’s mRNA-1273. The Indonesian Food and Drug Monitoring Agency (BPOM) previously ruled against granting an EUA to the Sinovac vaccine candidate because of what regulators said was a lack of data on its effectiveness. The first regulatory approval decision by Indonesian authorities is now expected to be made in late January 2021. Indonesia: State-run news sources in Indonesia have reported that 1.2 million doses of Sinovac’s CoronaVac vaccine candidate arrived in the country on 6 December. A further 1.8 million doses are scheduled to arrive in early January 2021, according to local authorities. Israel: Israel’s Ministry of Health has expanded an APA order for the supply of Moderna’s mRNA-1273 vaccine candidate. According to a statement, the ministry has agreed to procure an additional 4 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine candidate. This will bring Israel’s total APA order for mRNA-1273 to 6 million overall. The Jerusalem Post news source reported that a previous APA deal, struck between the Ministry of Health and Moderna in June 2020, was valued at an estimated USD73 million, meaning that each dose unit cost about USD12. The financial details of the expanded APA remain confidential, and it is unclear whether the unit cost has increased.Netherlands: Prime Minister Mark Rutte has indicated that healthcare authorities in the Netherlands are preparing to receive and distribute about 1 million doses of Pfizer/BioNTech’s BNT162b2, potentially allowing a vaccination programme to start from 4 January onwards. This is set to be followed by the planned arrival of 400,000 doses of Moderna’s mRNA-1273 over the first quarter of 2021. Poland: The first deliveries of COVID-19 vaccines will potentially arrive in Poland from early January 2021, according to the Polish prime minister’s chief of staff, Michal Dworczyk. Healthcare authorities expect to receive about 45 million doses, including through the EU joint procurement programme. Russia: Head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) Kirill Dmitriev has been quoted as saying that authorities are gearing up to administer the Sputnik V vaccine to 2 million Russians in December. Russia: The Russian Ministry of Health has registered the manufacturer maximum selling price for Gamaleya Institute’s Sputnik V vaccine for COVID-19 at RUB1,942 (USD26.10) for the two components together, or RUB9,710 for a pack of five two-component kits, according to reports in Pharmvestnik and Vademecum. No price limit was set for the EpiVacCorona vaccine (from Vektor, Russia). Both vaccines already have Russian interim approval, are included in the vital and essential drugs list (EDL or ZHNVLP), and are to be made available free to the Russian population. In addition, in response to an order last week from President Vladimir Putin, a major expansion of public vaccination was formally rolled out on 5 December in Moscow, prioritising workers with high-risk occupations in healthcare, education, social services, and law enforcement. According to Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova, quoted from a government briefing reported in Pharmvestnik, voluntary mass vaccination will be rolled out to all regions of Russia by the end of next week. According to Golikova, 168,000 doses of Sputnik V had been introduced into civil circulation as of 1 December, and introduction of EpiVacCorona vaccinations will begin later this month. An electronic registry for vaccinations has been opened in Moscow, and eligible workers will be required to submit evidence confirming their occupation.  South Africa: South Africa’s Ministry of Health issued a public statement on 4 December indicating that it expects to receive COVID-19 vaccine deliveries via the WHO’s COVAX global vaccine distribution scheme from around the second quarter of 2021 onwards.  United Kingdom: UK healthcare authorities are reportedly preparing to administer the first doses to patients of the recently approved Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine from 8 December. A prioritisation schedule calls for the first vaccine doses to be administered to individuals aged over 80 and frontline healthcare workers, followed by nursing home staff and residents. IHS Markit has previously reported that about 800,000 doses of the vaccine will be available in the country in the first week of the vaccination campaign.  United States: President-elect Joe Biden has nominated California Attorney-General Xavier Becerra as his appointment to be the next secretary of health and human services. In addition, Biden will reportedly nominate the current head of infectious diseases at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Rochelle Walensky, as the administration’s choice to lead the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Russia has not set a retail price for Sputnik V, however, and the Gamaleya Institute has confirmed that the vaccine will not be available in the private sector in Russia. Meanwhile, the CEO of the SII has announced that its version of the AstraZeneca vaccine, Covishield, which is being produced in India, will be sold in the private market as early as March 2021 for about USD8 per dose. The CEO confirmed that initial doses will go to the Indian government at a much lower price of USD3 per dose; however, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already suggested that the country will need 300 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine before July 2021 to be distributed to frontline health workers and priority groups. The government has not yet made a pre-order for the vaccine, and is waiting for regulatory approval that could come soon after the UK approval of AstraZeneca’s AZD1222, according to the CEO. This suggests that 20–30 million doses of Covishield will be directed towards the private sector prior to the Indian government’s need for vaccines being met. The country has a major challenge in vaccinating 1.4 billion individuals while battling one of the worst outbreaks of COVID-19 that has led to 9.5 million infections and 139,000 deaths. Several other lower- and middle-income countries waiting to purchase Covishield could encounter further delays in access if the Indian government prevents exports before its own population has been immunised. According to the Financial Times, this increases the chances of a secondary market for vaccines where people unable to access vaccines locally or from other countries could pay to purchase the vaccine, potentially delaying access to those most in need globally. With vaccine supplies not meeting demand, corruption and the emergence of a black market are also a possibility. In a statement to the Financial Times, AstraZeneca has noted, “The agreements with our partners around the world, including the Serum Institute of India, prioritise the supply to all governments and multilateral organisations in order to honour our commitment to broad and equitable access at no profit during the pandemic.”&copy; 2020, IHS Markit Inc.

"Risk: Regulatory burden; Protests and riotsSectors or assets affected: Social media and instant messaging applications; News organisations; Inbound cargoOn 27 June, local newspaper Sing Tao Daily and other news outlets claimed that Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam's administration was considering invoking the Emergency Regulations Ordinance (ERO) to contain ongoing protests. It would allow the Hong Kong government to bypass the legislative process and institute any regulations the chief executive's office considers """"desirable to public interest"""" in times of """"emergency or public danger"""". These include censoring media outlets, banning public gatherings, suppressing mass communication (possibly including internet censorship), direct control of Hong Kong's ports and customs offices, and appropriation of private property. The report, if true, underscores the Hong Kong government's eagerness to exhaust the legal options of the special administrative region before allowing the deployment of security forces under the command of the mainland Chinese government. Most parts of Hong Kong outside protest areas â mainly around government offices and police stations in Admiralty plus transport nodes such as main roads â remain peaceful. Significance: If invoked, ERO powers are likely to target social media applications and news providers that protesters depend on to organise and share tactical information. Inbound cargo will probably be delayed, usually for hours at most, as customs officials search for equipment sent by overseas sympathisers that could facilitate protests. The ERO would also motivate the US Congress to pass its Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act with bipartisan support in September, after the summer recess. This would revoke Hong Kong's privilege as a separate customs area under the 1992 US-Hong Kong Policy Act. The likelihood of the ERO being invoked would rise if protests threaten the lives of police and pro-China legislators or cause major damage to state property. Turnout of more than 1 million people in the planned 31 August 2019 demonstrations in Central will in turn increase the likelihood of escalating violence, whereas Lam directly addressing protesters' """"five-point demands"""" will almost certainly dissipate protests.

"On 23 January 2019, opposition leader Juan Guaido, head of the National Assembly, proclaimed himself interim president of Venezuela before thousands of his supporters and called on them to stay on the streets. This followed a failed military police (National Guard) mutiny on 21 January in in the locality of Petare in the Caracas Sucre municipality. Forty-three members of the National Guard were arrested, after they had called through social media for the armed forces not to recognise President Nicolas Maduro. A statement from Minister of Defence Padrino Lopez claimed that the arrestees, all from 43 Command of the National Guard, had stolen weapons from a barracks that same day. Similar failed mutinies/coup attempts in the last two years have included an attack on a military base in Valencia, Carabobo, to steal weapons, an attack on the Supreme Court and Ministry of Interior, and a UAV assassination attempt against Maduro at a military parade on 6 August 2017. Maduro was sworn in for a new 2019-25 mandate on 10 January, but his government has not been recognised by the US, Canada, the EU, and most Latin American countries. On 23 January, the same countries recognised Guaido as the legitimate president of Venezuela, while Russia, China and Turkey have all confirmed their recognition of Maduro as president, and Russia has warned the US against military intervention.Since 21 January, protests have increased rapidly, including roadblocks, arson attacks on ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) party buildings and instances of looting in the west of Caracas in the neighbourhoods of San Jose de Cotiza in Libertador municipality, as well as in other neighbourhoods, including 23 de Enero, Antimano, Autopista Caracas - La Guaira, Avenida Fuerzas Armadas, Avenida Panteon, El Valle, La Pastora, El Valle and nearby areas. Despite Venezuela's economic situation, and international pressure seeking a timetable for early free and fair elections, the high military command continues to be loyal to the government. Top officers currently have little incentive to withdraw support for Maduro as he has granted control to the armed forces of oil, ports, and imports, and some military factions are directly involved in illegal activities, including drug trafficking, fuel smuggling, and illegal mining. The current emergence of protests in the western part of Caracas, however, will test their loyalty to Maduro. This part of the city is where the Miraflores Presidential Palace is located and the government rarely allows any protests in this area. The use of tear gas, or even live fire, resulting in wounding or mass arrests of those living in shanty towns, would likely accelerate anti-government discontent in the security forces, increasing the likelihood of new mutinies among the military and of defections among the military leadership.

"On Wednesday, India began its 21-day nationwide lockdown in order to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19). As part of the lockdown, all non-essential businesses and locations were closed and non-essential movement of people was banned. The restrictions will remain in place until at least April 14. In justifying the lockdown, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that if the country could not properly observe the 21-day lockdown, it risked setting the country back 21 years. All international passenger flights have also been suspended.



While freight transportation is exempted and essential businesses remain open, there have already been severe impacts on supply chains in the country. There were reports that despite being part of essential production, some trucks carrying raw materials for food products or even items like bread were being stopped and delayed at checkpoints or state borders. Different procedures and requirements between states are reportedly contributing to the transportation issues, along with a shortage of workers and truck drivers. Even though metal manufacturers are considered to be essential, companies like JSW Steel and Hindalco have reduced their operations. Businesses not considered essential, such as auto manufacturers like Maruti Suzuki, Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, and Tata Motors have shut down production in the country, along with appliance and electronics companies like Panasonic, Samsung, LG, and Foxconn.



Port operations have also been significantly affected, even though maritime shipping has been deemed an essential service. The Ministry of Shipping has told ports that they could use the outbreak to invoke force majeure to break their contract obligations. At least seven ports, including Krishnapatnam, Dhamra, Mundra, Tuna, Gopalpur, Karaikal, and Gangavaram have already declared force majeure. The disruptions are expected to impact nearly all types of imports and exports through the ports. Companies have also reported that although ports remain open, transportation availability to and from ports has been severely disrupted. There has also been evidence of increasing congestion at ports, with the number of vessels anchored off the coast increasing to 78, which is 22 percent higher from a week before.



Assessment: India has taken rapid and comprehensive steps in order to control COVID-19. The country has only reported 649 cases and 13 deaths, but there are serious concerns that if an outbreak took place, it could spread incredibly fast and be hard to control. The Ministry of Health said on March 26 that there is not yet hard evidence that widespread community transmission is taking place, but this is complicated by the fact that India has one of the lowest testing rates per capita in the world. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) already said on March 24 that widespread and ongoing transmission is taking place, raising its notice level for India to its highest level: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/coronavirus-india. It remains unclear if India imposed the lockdown in time to prevent a major outbreak or if the measures will be as effective as hoped. It is likely that as testing increases, the number of cases will rise significantly, which will hopefully make the overall situation clearer. Customers are advised to closely monitor the situation and expect severe disruptions to business operations and any supply chains that are associated with India due to the lockdown.",wednesday india began 21-day nationwide lockdown order prevent spread novel coronavirus covid-19 part lockdown non-essential business location closed non-essential movement people banned restriction remain place least april 14. justifying lockdown prime minister narendra modi said country could properly observe 21-day lockdown risked setting country back 21 year international passenger flight also suspended freight transportation exempted essential business remain open already severe impact supply chain country report despite part essential production truck carrying raw material food product even item like bread stopped delayed checkpoint state border different procedure requirement state reportedly contributing transportation issue along shortage worker truck driver even though metal manufacturer considered essential company like jsw steel hindalco reduced operation business considered essential auto manufacturer like maruti suzuki toyota honda hyundai tata motor shut production country along appliance electronics company like panasonic samsung lg foxconn port operation also significantly affected even though maritime shipping deemed essential service ministry shipping told port could use outbreak invoke force majeure break contract obligation least seven port including krishnapatnam dhamra mundra tuna gopalpur karaikal gangavaram already declared force majeure disruption expected impact nearly type import export port company also reported although port remain open transportation availability port severely disrupted also evidence increasing congestion port number vessel anchored coast increasing 78 22 percent higher week assessment india taken rapid comprehensive step order control covid-19 country reported 649 case 13 death serious concern outbreak took place could spread incredibly fast hard control ministry health said march 26 yet hard evidence widespread community transmission taking place complicated fact india one lowest testing rate per caput world u.s. center disease control prevention cdc already said march 24 widespread ongoing transmission taking place raising notice level india highest level http //wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/coronavirus-india remains unclear india imposed lockdown time prevent major outbreak measure effective hoped likely testing increase number case rise significantly hopefully make overall situation clearer customer advised closely monitor situation expect severe disruption business operation supply chain associated india due lockdown,"Miscellaneous Events, Ground Transportation Advisory, Public Health Advisory, Network Disruption, Maritime Advisory, Regulatory Advisory, Security Advisory",Others

"On Sunday, an explosion was reported near the intersection of Nathan Rd and Fife St in the Mong Kok area of Kowloon. The incident took place near a parked police vehicle after police officers had disembarked and were clearing roadblocks following another evening of violent protests across Hong Kong that resulted in over 200 arrests. The explosive was reportedly detonated remotely by a cell phone and was placed in a flower pot around six feet from the police van. No injuries were reported, although police said that the device was meant to injure or kill officers. Police have said that the intensity of the explosion was relatively low and was likely comprised of homemade materials.

Assessment: The use of an IED by protesters was not completely unexpected, as police carried out two raids on warehouses in July and August where explosive materials were found and suspects from pro-independence groups were arrested. The raid on the Lung Shing Factory Building in Tusen Wan in July found two pounds of the chemical triacetone triperoxide (TATP), which is a powerful explosive that can be made from common household ingredients, along with incendiary devices, acids, and sharp weapons. The raid on an industrial building in Fo Tan in August found over 30 smoke bombs and a significant amount of cash. If the use of explosives becomes a regular tactic by the protesters, it will seriously deteriorate the security situation in Hong Kong, particularly if they result in any casualties. The use of a cell phone as a remote detonator could also give police justification to suspend mobile phone services in certain areas when protests are taking place.

"IHS Markit perspectiveImplicationsThe cumulative number of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases globally has now passed the 43.5-million mark, according to Johns Hopkins University data. An important new study conducted by Imperial College from its major REACT population trial has indicated that COVID-19 antibody levels in the general community in England declined steadily between June and September. The rate of decline was greatest among asymptomatically infected people and in older individuals (aged 75 and over). Immunity among healthcare workers was generally maintained, possibly because of continued SARS-CoV-2 exposure. The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged national leaders not to abandon strong measures to tackle COVID-19, following recent US comments regarding a shift in focus towards mitigation. In Japan, the government has announced a new funding plan for potential provision of COVID-19 vaccinations to the public, free of charge.OutlookOn the research front, Eli Lilly (US) has faced a setback with the termination of the hospitalised patient arm of its neutralising antibody trial, since it had shown little benefit in this patient segment. However, there were no safety concerns for this treatment, which is still considered promising in other patient groups, and other trials evaluating this antibody in less severe COVID-19 patients are now continuing after a short suspension. Separately, studies have indicated the potential for low-dose aspirin in preventing serious COVID-19 complications, and for expanded T-cells from convalescent patients to boost immunity in compromised individuals.Update on COVID-19 infectionsThe number of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases globally had reached 43,504,448 at the time of writing on 27 October, up from a tally of 43,117,883 reported the previous day, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The United States continues to lead the global infections ranking, reporting 8,704,534 cases at the time of writing, followed by India with 7,946,429 cases. Next in the ranking are Brazil (5,409,854), Russia (1,520,800), France (1,209,651), Argentina (1,102,301), Spain (1,098,320), Colombia (1,025,052), the United Kingdom (897,470), and Mexico (895,326).The number of confirmed deaths globally had reached 1,159,533 at the time of writing, up from 1,154,703 the previous day. The ranking is led by the US, with 225,735 fatalities at the time of reporting. This is followed by Brazil with 157,397 deaths, India (119,502), Mexico (89,171), the UK (45,088), Italy (37,479), France (35,052), Spain (35,031), Peru (34,149), and Iran (32,953). United States: Just one week ahead of the presidential election in the US, new COVID-19 infections are on the rise in 47 out of 50 states; 34 states are also reporting growing numbers of deaths, according to a report in the UK’s The Guardian. The seven-day rolling average for new infections reached a record 68,767 on Sunday (25 October), exceeding the previous high of 67,293 recorded in July. Daily mortality statistics remain significantly below levels seen in April, but the average number of COVID-19 deaths across all of the US rose by 10% over the past 14 days, and reached 794 on Sunday. Modelling by scientists from the University of Washington suggests that the total number of fatalities could reach as many as 386,000 by February next year. Vaccines, treatments, and diagnostic development updateVaccinesCanada: Canadian firm Precision Nanosystems announced the receipt of CAD18.2 million (USD13.8 million) in funding from the Canadian government to develop a COVID-19 vaccine based on its mRNA technology. The company is planning clinical trials to develop a cost-effective COVID-19 vaccine using self-amplifying mRNA vectors, lipid-based drug delivery, and nanomedicine manufacturing. Canada: The National Research Council of Canada’s Industrial Research Assistance Program has provided CAD5 million to Canadian biotech Entos Pharmaceuticals for a COVID-19 DNA vaccine candidate, Covigenix, using its Fusogenix drug delivery platform. The candidate induced a strong neutralising antibody response and a “potent and balanced” T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2 in preclinical trials, and a Canadian Phase I trial is planned.Israel: Further details have been released in The Jerusalem Post on the vaccine candidate Brilife, under development by the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR), and it is expected to enter Phase I trials in November. The vaccine is based on an animal virus vector, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which is non-pathogenic in humans, that has been engineered to display COVID-19 proteins. The candidate has shown efficacy in preclinical studies in pigs. South Korea – United Kingdom: The South Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety announced that it has initiated a preliminary review of UK firm AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate for potential fast-track approval under the ministry’s rapid COVID-19 treatment and vaccine approval programme, according to a report in Reuters. The ministry has formed a screening team, which is currently reviewing preclinical test data for the vaccine, and a filing for formal approval under the ministry’s emergency scheme is expected within 90 days. TreatmentsCanada – United States: Canadian firm Revive Therapeutics has announced an update from its ongoing Phase III study in the US to evaluate bucillamine, a repurposed rheumatoid arthritis drug, in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Revive estimated that over 200 patients will complete the trial for interim analysis by the end of December. The interim analysis will determine the optimal dosing for the remainder of the trial, and for future planned studies in more severe cases. United States: Eli Lilly (US) has announced that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)-sponsored clinical trial, ACTIV-3, will no longer be enrolling additional COVID-19 hospitalised patients into the treatment arm for its COVID-19 neutralising antibody bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555), in development with AbCellera (US). The recommendation was based on interim data that suggested the investigational SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody had no effect on recovery of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in advanced stages of their disease. There were no significant differences noted regarding safety between the groups included in the dataset. Other trials investigating bamlanivimab in mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients (the NIH's ACTIV-2 study), in recently diagnosed patients in the ambulatory setting (Lilly's Phase II BLAZE-1 trial), and for prevention of COVID-19 in residents and staff at long-term care facilities (Lilly's Phase III BLAZE-2 trial) all remain ongoing, and Lilly considers its antibody to have potential in these less severe settings.United States: A new landmark study conducted at the University of Maryland has indicated that hospitalised COVID-19 patients receiving daily low-dose aspirin for protection against cardiovascular disease had a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 complications or death, versus those who were not taking aspirin. Patients taking aspirin were less likely to receive ventilation or intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, and were more likely to survive infection than those who were not on aspirin. The study results were published in the journal Anesthesia and Analgesia here. The researchers stated that these findings provide “cautious optimism” that this low-cost intervention may help prevent severe COVID-19 complications, although they stressed that this needs to be confirmed via a randomised clinical trial (RCT).United States: The Global Coalition for Adaptive Research (GCAR) announced that the first patients have been enrolled in the immune modulation domain of the REMAP-COVID adaptive trial, a sub-study of the major international REMAP-CAP trial. The new trial arm, conducted at over 20 hospitals across the US, will aim to test multiple interventions of hospitalised COVID-19 patients, including US firm Amgen’s apremilast and Japanese firm Eisai’s eritoran, across multiple international trial sites. Apremilast is an oral PDE4 inhibitor, which may modulate the production of inflammatory cytokines and other mediators of pulmonary inflammation, and is already approved in over 45 countries for inflammatory conditions. In the new study, it will be evaluated for prevention of respiratory distress in moderate-to-severe adult COVID-19 patients. Eritoran is an investigational TLR4 antagonist, and has been previously evaluated for severe sepsis. It may suppress the severity of inflammation and signals triggering cytokine storm in COVID-19.United States: A new study from the Children’s National Hospital in Washington, published in the journal Blood (here), has indicated that expanded T-cells from peripheral blood of convalescent COVID-19 patients have maintained the ability to target proteins essential to COVID-19 virus function, besides the spike protein. The researchers have suggested that this strategy could be used in adoptive immunotherapy to protect vulnerable patients, especially those with compromised immune systems due to cancer therapy or bone marrow transplant. The research team is now seeking approval from the US FDA for a Phase I trial evaluating the use of COVID-19-specific T-cells to boost immune responses in such patients.DiagnosticsEurope – United States: US firm Ortho Clinical Diagnostics has received a European CE Mark for distribution of the VITROS SARS-CoV-2 antigen test, which detects active SARS-CoV-2 infection, throughout the European Union. The company also filed an emergency use authorisation (EUA) submission for the US FDA for the test, which Ortho has claimed has 97.8% sensitivity and 99.2% specificity.United States: US biotech Helix has announced the receipt of an expanded EUA from the US FDA for on-site unsupervised self-collection and asymptomatic screening or population-based testing using the Helix COVID-19 Test. This will eliminate the need for a healthcare professional to oversee collection, which is currently required for most COVID-19 tests, and will give agencies more flexibility in the operation of test sites and collection centres, potentially reducing collection costs, and addressing staffing shortages and resource allocation across the country.United States: US firm Truvian Sciences announced that it has submitted an EUA filing to the US FDA for its Easy Check COVID-19 IgM/IgG Point-of-Care Antibody Test. The company released US clinical trial data for this test, which uses fingerstick samples, indicating that sensitivity and specificity rates were on a par with other lateral-flow COVID-19 antibody tests. This system should eliminate the need for a blood draw or outsourced testing in centralised laboratories, and may reduce the sample-to-result timeframe from days down to 10 minutes, while not compromising accuracy.Other developmentsBrazil: Brazil’s Public Prosecutor’s Office has asked the Ministry of Health (MoH) for an explanation of the reasons for the alleged cancellation of an agreement to purchase 46 million doses of Chinese firm Sinovac’s inactivated whole-virion COVID-19 vaccine candidate CoronaVac, newspaper Folha de S. Paulo has reported. The agreement was reportedly cancelled by President Jair Bolsonaro last week, just one day after the MoH had announced a deal with São Paulo’s Butantan Institute, which is carrying out clinical tests of the vaccine and holds a technology transfer agreement with Sinovac, in an apparent political clash with São Paulo governor and political rival João Doria. According to Folha, the public prosecutor has asked the ministry to clarify whether the deal had been nullified, and, should that be the case, to explain the technical reasons behind “favouring” AstraZeneca and Oxford University’s candidate vaccine AZD1222, which is also being tested in Brazil and subject to a technology transfer agreement, over CoronaVac. The prosecutor’s intervention comes as the Brazilian president was quoted on Monday as questioning the value of vaccines as a way of tackling the pandemic, telling supporters that, in his opinion, it would be “cheaper and easier to invest in a cure rather than a vaccine”, as reported by Reuters. Europe: Officials at the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have indicated that the regulator would be prepared to authorise a COVID-19 vaccine that presented an efficacy level below 50%, provided that it was deemed safe enough, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). This would enable the approval of vaccines at a lower level of efficacy than that required by other regulators, including the US FDA. The guidelines for the development and licensure of COVID-19 vaccines released by the US FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research in June state that “the primary efficacy endpoint point estimate for a placebo-controlled efficacy trial should be at least 50%, with the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval expected not to be less than 30%"""". The same minimum efficacy level has also been also adopted by China’s Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE), and hinted at by officials at Brazil’s medicines regulator Anvisa. According to the WSJ, officials at the EMA were “cautiously optimistic” that at least one vaccine might become available on a broad scale in the first quarter of 2021. France: France’s USPO (Union des Syndicats de Pharmaciens d'Officine) pharmacists' union has requested additional public and private nurses to volunteer to facilitate the administration of recently authorised antigen-based COVID-19 diagnostics in pharmacies. The USPO leadership also appealed to medical and nursing students to apply to help administer antigen tests in order to ensure that the diagnostic services, when they launch in pharmacies in November, are fully available throughout regions. The USPO has recommended the adoption of a protocol for performing diagnostic tests. This requires tests to be administered by two qualified staff, via an appointment process and at well-defined times of the day in a location of the pharmacy that is outside the normal business area accessed by customers.Italy: Italian Minister of Health Roberto Speranza announced the start of a pilot programme whereby rapid saliva and antigen-based COVID-19 diagnostics could become widely available via community pharmacies. The region of Piedmont in the northwest of the country will be the location of the first pilot. From next week, the public will be asked to book appointments to have tests conducted through pharmacies. Tests will be administered at the pharmacy centers by healthcare professionals (pharmacists and nurses), and samples will then be delivered to public and private laboratories in the region for analysis. The combination of pharmacists and nurses administering diagnostics has the potential to reduce the workload on the hospital sector and to identify cases more quickly. Other regions have indicated interest in joining the pilot, including Lazio. Pharmacies in the Emilia Romagna region already facilitate access to serological tests, and the number of people using this service is increasing. Japan: The government of Japan on Tuesday (27 October) approved a funding plan to provide COVID-19 vaccinations to the public, free of charge, The Japan Times has reported. According to the source, the plan also envisages that the government will assume the cost of any health damage potentially caused by a vaccine. The government has set aside JPY671.4 billion (USD6.4 billion) and is aiming to secure a sufficient amount of vaccines to immunise the population in the first half of 2021. According to the IHS Markit COVID-19 vaccines advanced purchase agreements tracker, the country has so far secured advance supply deals for vaccines developed by AstraZeneca/Oxford University (UK) and Pfizer (US)/BioNTech (Germany).United Kingdom: Newly released findings from a study led by Imperial College London have shown that the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the English population has declined between June and September, suggesting that immunity levels against COVID-19 wane over time. The ongoing REal Time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) study uses antibody finger-prick tests to track past infections and monitor the progress of the pandemic. It has so far tested more than 365,000 people in England in three cross-sectional surveys between late June and September 2020. A summary of the study’s main findings reported overall antibody positivity rates of 6.0% [5.8, 6.1], 4.8% [4.7, 5.0], and 4.4% [4.3, 4.5] for the consecutive waves, indicating a steady pattern of decline. A further breakdown of the data revealed that the rate of decline was greater among people with an asymptomatic infection compared with those who reported a positive PCR test, and was also greater in the oldest age group (75 and older) compared with the youngest age group (18–24). However, antibody positivity did not change over the course of the study among healthcare workers, which was linked to this group’s continued exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. According to the study’s authors, the data “suggest the possibility of decreasing population immunity and increasing risk of reinfection as detectable antibodies decline in the population”. A non-peer-reviewed pre-print report of the initial findings from the study can be accessed here. World: The WHO’s director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday (27 October) urged political leaders not to abandon the fight against COVID-19, in comments made a day after US President Donald Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows said that it was not possible to control the pandemic and therefore focus has shifted to mitigation. Tedros was quoted by the UK’s The Guardian as saying that control and mitigation efforts were both crucial, calling on leaders to “balance the disruption to lives and livelihoods”. Also on Monday, the agency’s head of emergency operations, Mike Ryan, was quoted by Reuters as saying that a “serious acceleration” of efforts to tackle the pandemic was needed in Europe. Ryan warned that an “increasing lack of capacity to do any effective form of contact-tracing” was risking a further deterioration of the situation in the region. More of today's IHS Markit COVID-19 analysisCanada: Canadian Medical Association estimates CAD1.3 billion needed to clear medical procedure backlog due to COVID-19 virus pandemic (here)United States: Lilly, NIH discontinue enrolment in bamlanivimab arm of ACTIV-3 trial due to lack of benefit in hospitalised COVID-19 patients (here)Outlook and implicationsThe World Health Organization (WHO) has urged national leaders not to abandon strong measures to tackle COVID-19, following recent US comments regarding a shift in focus towards mitigation. One positive measure in Japan has been the announcement of a new funding plan for potential provision of COVID-19 vaccinations to the public, free of charge.On the research front, Eli Lilly (US) has faced a setback with the termination of the hospitalised patient arm of its neutralising antibody trial, since it had shown little benefit in this patient segment. However, there were no safety concerns for this treatment, which is still considered to be promising in other patient groups; other trials evaluating this antibody in less severe COVID-19 patients are now continuing, after a short suspension. Studies have indicated the potential for low-dose aspirin to prevent serious COVID-19 complications, and for expanded T-cells from convalescent patients to boost immunity in compromised individuals.The findings from Imperial College’s major REACT population trial, indicating that COVID-19 antibody levels in the general community in England declined steadily between June and September this year, are a worrying development, especially for the data indicating there is more rapid waning of immunity in older individuals (aged 75 and over). However, the fact that immunity appears to have been maintained more steadily among healthcare workers, possibly because of continued SARS-CoV-2 exposure, is an interesting finding. Nonetheless, these results, indicating a general wane of immunity over time in the community, have important implications in exposing the risks of any strategy based on “herd immunity”, and also raise important considerations for vaccine development strategies.&copy; 2020, IHS Markit Inc.

"Media sources report that hundreds of people have taken to the streets in Tunisia in recent days to protest the government’s response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The March 30-31 demonstrations took place in Mnilha and Ettadhamen, two working-class districts on the outskirts of Tunis, with residents marching to local government offices, demanding economic assistance from the government and denouncing a night-time curfew and lockdown in place since March 17 and March 22, respectively, to prevent further spread of the coronavirus. Some protesters also reportedly blocked roads and burned tires. Despite the demonstrations, the government announced the extension of the lockdown, curfew, and other COVID-19 prevention measures for another two weeks on Tuesday. Originally slated to end on April 4, the restrictions will now remain in place until at least April 19. Tunisian President Kais Saied also announced the impending release of 1,420 inmates to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the country’s prison system. As of Wednesday, Tunisia has recorded 394 positive coronavirus cases, including ten deaths attributed to the disease.



Meanwhile, in Egypt, which has recorded 710 positive COVID-19 infections and 46 deaths as of Wednesday, authorities began implementing a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all citizens returning to the country from abroad via repatriation flights; all international and domestic air travel has been halted until at least April 12 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Hotels will serve as the location for the quarantines, with associated costs to be incurred by the returnee. Those in Egypt are reminded of a nationwide curfew between the hours of 7:00 PM and 6:00 PM local time through at least April 8. On Wednesday, it was reported that several apartment buildings in Port Said have been placed on lockdown after a handful of residents tested positive for COVID-19.



Finally, in Algeria, President Abdelmadjid Tebboune called on citizens to practice “discipline” on Wednesday, as the country’s COVID-19 case tally rose to 716, with 44 deaths. Regional media sources reported that Algerians have been flouting the government’s restrictions, which include a lockdown and curfew between the hours of 7:00 PM and 7:00 AM local time in Algiers and nine other provinces, a week-long lockdown quarantine in Blida, and the closure of academic institutions—extended on Tuesday—worship places, most retail establishments, and restaurants.



Assessment: Like most elsewhere in the world, the COVID-19 caseload continues to increase in North Africa. By and large, local governments have adopted similar strategies to combat the coronavirus—restricting travel and movement and encouraging social distancing. However, the pandemic and the measures taken to combat the virus could have significant economic consequences in a region where distrust of the government and state authorities and socioeconomic inequality run high. Indeed, multiple governments have unveiled plans to provide stipends to those who lose their jobs; however, the roll-out of the financial assistance is unlikely to go off without a hitch, and the longer government restrictions prevent people from going to work, citizens’ livelihoods are more likely to be negatively affected, especially low-income earners. This could not only render some unable to purchase food and other necessities, it could also aggravate social tensions. With signs of unrest brewing in Spain and Italy this week, the latter of which has strong historical ties to Tunisia, protests akin to those in Mnilha and Ettadhamen in recent days could become more common. It is advisable to stay apprised of associated security developments in this regard.","medium source report hundred people taken street tunisia recent day protest government ’ response coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 pandemic march 30-31 demonstration took place mnilha ettadhamen two working-class district outskirt tunis resident marching local government office demanding economic assistance government denouncing night-time curfew lockdown place since march 17 march 22 respectively prevent spread coronavirus protester also reportedly blocked road burned tire despite demonstration government announced extension lockdown curfew covid-19 prevention measure another two week tuesday originally slated end april 4 restriction remain place least april 19. tunisian president kais saied also announced impending release 1,420 inmate prevent spread covid-19 country ’ prison system wednesday tunisia recorded 394 positive coronavirus case including ten death attributed disease meanwhile egypt recorded 710 positive covid-19 infection 46 death wednesday authority began implementing mandatory 14-day quarantine citizen returning country abroad via repatriation flight international domestic air travel halted least april 12 prevent spread coronavirus hotel serve location quarantine associated cost incurred returnee egypt reminded nationwide curfew hour 7:00 pm 6:00 pm local time least april 8. wednesday reported several apartment building port said placed lockdown handful resident tested positive covid-19 finally algeria president abdelmadjid tebboune called citizen practice “ discipline ” wednesday country ’ covid-19 case tally rose 716 44 death regional medium source reported algerian flouting government ’ restriction include lockdown curfew hour 7:00 pm 7:00 local time algiers nine province week-long lockdown quarantine blida closure academic institutions—extended tuesday—worship place retail establishment restaurant assessment like elsewhere world covid-19 caseload continues increase north africa large local government adopted similar strategy combat coronavirus—restricting travel movement encouraging social distancing however pandemic measure taken combat virus could significant economic consequence region distrust government state authority socioeconomic inequality run high indeed multiple government unveiled plan provide stipend lose job however roll-out financial assistance unlikely go without hitch longer government restriction prevent people going work citizen ’ livelihood likely negatively affected especially low-income earner could render unable purchase food necessity could also aggravate social tension sign unrest brewing spain italy week latter strong historical tie tunisia protest akin mnilha ettadhamen recent day could become common advisable stay apprised associated security development regard","Protest / Riot, Ground Transportation Advisory, Public Health Advisory, Security Advisory",Worker Strike

"On Monday, Canada Post workers associated with the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) commenced rotating strikes across the country. On Monday, workers in Victoria, Windsor, Halifax, and Edmonton participated in the labor action. On Tuesday, the strike took place in the Greater Toronto Area, excluding Scarborough. The work stoppage in the Greater Toronto Area was significantly impactful as the area hosts some of Canada s largest mail sorting facilities. The Gateway Postal Facility in Mississauga was impacted by the work stoppage, and reportedly processes approximately 70 percent of all parcels mailed within Canada. Negotiations between Canada Post and the CUPW have stalled over issues involving how Canada Post will address the increasing amount of parcels shipped throughout Canada, as well as health and safety concerns, and alleged forced overtime. New locations are expected to be selected by CUPW leadership for participation in the rotating strike daily until progress is made in negotiations. Parcels and letters will not be accepted or shipped in affected locations during the 24-hour strike.

"The nationwide coal shortage in India due to supply and demand-side inventory mismanagement since September 2017 has started to impact industrial manufacturing throughout the country. What started as a prioritization issue of expending domestic and Indonesian-imported supply by Coal India has now ballooned into an industry-wide shortage that threatens to impact key sectors. 
The material shortages can be attributed to mismanagement. Coal India is responsible for 80% of coal production in the country, a majority of which is used in coal-fired power plants. Industry sources allege that the Coal Ministry has decided that independent power producers would be the priority recipients of coal. This prioritization, however, is to the detriment of captive power plants operated by manufacturing plants.
Further to this, the state-run firm’s explanation for supply shortcomings is due to the unavailability of rail coal cars. The decision made by the federal government on September 22 to allocate rail cars to coal plants instead of manufacturing facilities has resulted in the rail car unavailability in its current state. As a result, transportation of coal from mines as well as the coal-importing terminals at Mundra, Paradip, Vinshakhapatnam, and Krishnapatnam has been impacted.
Productive industries have taken note of this prioritization. The Aluminum Association of India has requested a halt to the government’s power production prioritization as the status quo has endangered aluminum production. The association is one among many represented by the Indian Captive Power Producers’ Association; other members include representatives from the steel, cement, and paper industries. Their grievance also stems from the lack of fulfillment of a contractually guaranteed 75% coal receipt from the Coal Ministry, which is currently between 15 to 50%, which the Ministry attributes to decreased capacity in alternative energy sources. As a result of these allocation strategies, aluminum, cement, steel, and paper producers will continue to face shortages in the short-run. This may, in turn, impact raw material exports as well as the Indian domestic automotive industry, among others.
The issue has also been exacerbated by climate factors, as coking is only successful with dry coal, a state threatened annually by the monsoon season. Based on domestic demand and the intensity of storm s during the season, coal imports are a necessity.  For example, from 2017 to 2018, India’s coal imports rose 35% from 15.6 million tons to 21.1 million tons by September 2018. Moreover, increased heat waves in recent months have led to increased demand for energy units by 180 billion units, or a 1.15 % increase on a monthly basis. Predictions also show elevated rainfall during the wet season compared to previous years. As such, sectors from energy through manufacturing will require ever-increasing quantities of coking coal, predominantly from South Africa and Indonesia.
As a result of the coal-to-aluminum shortage, several critical industries throughout India are reporting production slumps. In addition to a slump of 4.3% in mining productivity, down from 9.3% in the previous year, there is also production shortcomings reported in Indian original equipment manufacturers, like Eicher or Tata. Should these shortages continue, even more considerable domestic sourcing difficulties may transpire, and create upward pressure to source raw materials abroad. Supply chain managers should therefore be mindful of these conditions and plan accordingly.",nationwide coal shortage india due supply demand-side inventory mismanagement since september 2017 started impact industrial manufacturing throughout country started prioritization issue expending domestic indonesian-imported supply coal india ballooned industry-wide shortage threatens impact key sector material shortage attributed mismanagement coal india responsible 80 coal production country majority used coal-fired power plant industry source allege coal ministry decided independent power producer would priority recipient coal prioritization however detriment captive power plant operated manufacturing plant state-run firm ’ explanation supply shortcoming due unavailability rail coal car decision made federal government september 22 allocate rail car coal plant instead manufacturing facility resulted rail car unavailability current state result transportation coal mine well coal-importing terminal mundra paradip vinshakhapatnam krishnapatnam impacted productive industry taken note prioritization aluminum association india requested halt government ’ power production prioritization status quo endangered aluminum production association one among many represented indian captive power producer ’ association member include representative steel cement paper industry grievance also stem lack fulfillment contractually guaranteed 75 coal receipt coal ministry currently 15 50 ministry attribute decreased capacity alternative energy source result allocation strategy aluminum cement steel paper producer continue face shortage short-run may turn impact raw material export well indian domestic automotive industry among others issue also exacerbated climate factor coking successful dry coal state threatened annually monsoon season based domestic demand intensity storm season coal import necessity example 2017 2018 india ’ coal import rose 35 15.6 million ton 21.1 million ton september 2018. moreover increased heat wave recent month led increased demand energy unit 180 billion unit 1.15 increase monthly basis prediction also show elevated rainfall wet season compared previous year sector energy manufacturing require ever-increasing quantity coking coal predominantly south africa indonesia result coal-to-aluminum shortage several critical industry throughout india reporting production slump addition slump 4.3 mining productivity 9.3 previous year also production shortcoming reported indian original equipment manufacturer like eicher tata shortage continue even considerable domestic sourcing difficulty may transpire create upward pressure source raw material abroad supply chain manager therefore mindful condition plan accordingly,Production Halt,Worker Strike

"At around 8:00 AM local time on Thursday, the New Diamond, an oil tanker, sent a distress signal when it was around 38 miles off the coast of Sangaman Kanda, in Sri Lanka’s Eastern Province. The ship had suffered an engine room explosion, which killed one crew member and started a fire. Both Sri Lankan and Indian naval and coastguard forces responded to the ship, safely removing the 22 other crew members. The two countries have been attempting to extinguish the fire burning on board the ship, using both vessel-based water cannons and helicopter water drops, and have been monitoring the ship’s movements from the air as well. Other vessels have towed the ship away from the Sri Lankan coast after it began to drift in that direction.



Assessment: The 1,080-foot New Diamond is registered in Panama and owned by Liberia’s Porto Emporios Shipping. It was transporting approximately 270,000 tons of oil and 1,700 tons of diesel fuel from Kuwait to Paradeep, India when the incident occurred. Sri Lankan Navy authorities have stated that there is no imminent threat of an oil spill from the New Diamond, and according to disaster management officials, the fire has not spread to the cargo of oil as of Friday morning. Media sources have reported that the fire has been at least somewhat contained to the superstructure of the ship and does not appear to have reached the cargo area. Sri Lankan government environmental authorities have cautioned, however, that a potential leak might be “one of the biggest environmental disasters not only in the region but in the world.” Of possible concern, too, is that Indian coastguard personnel have reported an approximately six-foot crack in the ship’s hull at a point about 30 feet above the water line, although it is not immediately clear if this is directly related to the fire. Officials in the Maldives have stated that they are monitoring the situation in case any potential oil spill should impact their waters. Once the fire on board the ship is under control, authorities plan to tow it into deeper waters and possibly transfer the cargo of oil to another vessel. While there is no indication that an oil spill is presently expected, it is advised to be aware of the potential for significant environmental impacts should an oil leak occur.","around 8:00 local time thursday new diamond oil tanker sent distress signal around 38 mile coast sangaman kanda sri lanka ’ eastern province ship suffered engine room explosion killed one crew member started fire sri lankan indian naval coastguard force responded ship safely removing 22 crew member two country attempting extinguish fire burning board ship using vessel-based water cannon helicopter water drop monitoring ship ’ movement air well vessel towed ship away sri lankan coast began drift direction assessment 1,080-foot new diamond registered panama owned liberia ’ porto emporios shipping transporting approximately 270,000 ton oil 1,700 ton diesel fuel kuwait paradeep india incident occurred sri lankan navy authority stated imminent threat oil spill new diamond according disaster management official fire spread cargo oil friday morning medium source reported fire least somewhat contained superstructure ship appear reached cargo area sri lankan government environmental authority cautioned however potential leak might “ one biggest environmental disaster region world. ” possible concern indian coastguard personnel reported approximately six-foot crack ship ’ hull point 30 foot water line although immediately clear directly related fire official maldives stated monitoring situation case potential oil spill impact water fire board ship control authority plan tow deeper water possibly transfer cargo oil another vessel indication oil spill presently expected advised aware potential significant environmental impact oil leak occur","Weather Advisory, Ground Transportation Advisory, Hazmat Response, Maritime Advisory",Weather

"Media reports, citing port circulars and an industry source, indicate that the United Arab Emirates has eased restrictions on the shipping of goods between it and Qatar. According to the report, the Abu Dhabi Ports authority has cancelled all previous directives banning the transfer of cargoes of Qatari and Emirati origin. The move reportedly applies to all Emirati ports; however, a ban on Qatari-flagged vessels and ships owned by Doha and domestic firms remains in place. The UAE, along with Bahrain, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, have maintained a land, air, and sea blockade of Qatar since June 2017 over Doha s alleged support of terrorism and close ties with regional rival Iran. 
 
	Assessment: The reason for the move remains unclear, as there have not been any signs of a diplomatic thaw between Qatar and the so-called  Quartet  countries (Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE).

"The president of Indonesia’s largest and most active labour union, the Confederation of Indonesian Labour Unions (Konfederasi Serikat Pekerja Indonesia: KSPI), Said Iqbal, said on 28 September that 5 million workers nationwide will stage protests and hold a national strike from 6-8 October to coincide with the passing of the Job Creation bill by parliament on 8 October. Said told Indonesian media that other major unions, including the All-Indonesia Confederation of Labour Unions (Konfederasi Serikat Pekerja Seluruh Indonesia: KSPSI) and the All Indonesia Labour Union (Serikat Pekerja Seluruh Indonesia: SPSI), will also take part in the protests and strikes. The nationwide strike will affect numerous industries including footwear, textiles, chemical, and automotive and automotive components. Said said the nationwide strike would be preceded by daily protests from 29 September and a demonstration outside parliament on 8 October. Protests will also take place outside local legislatures in provincial cities. The Job Creation bill is a key piece of legislation that the government views as crucial to improve Indonesia’s investment climate and it is therefore unlikely to make major concessions. Unions oppose the labour market liberalisation clauses of the bill, which they think will reduce workers’ welfare (see Indonesia 7 August 2020: Indonesia’s Job Creation bill likely to liberalise labour market and increase risk of protests and strikes). Significance: Barring a compromise in the next several days, the nationwide strike is set to become the largest since President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo came to power in 2014. The protests and strikes will affect major industrial cities, including the greater Jakarta region known locally by the acronym Jabodetabek, as well as Surabaya, Bandung, Medan and Batam island. Although Said said the protests will be “peaceful and orderly”, there is a high likelihood of local blockades preventing cargo from leaving industrial parks.  The protests will take place as many local governments, such as the Jakarta government, are imposing local lockdowns that include a prohibition on large gatherings in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus pandemic, increasing the likelihood of fighting   between protesters and police if attempts to disperse or arrest protesters are made. There is a high likelihood of striking workers intimidating workers from companies that do not participate in the strike as well as moderate likelihood of minor property damage. A last-minute decision by parliament to accommodate workers’ demands, for example on the maximum amount of severance payment and conditions on the use of short-term contracts, would improve the prospect of unions postponing or cancelling their action.

"On Thursday, Iran’s foreign ministry said that the nation’s coast guard has detained a United Arab Emirates-registered ship and arrested its crew for allegedly violating the country’s territorial waters. According to state media, the detention occurred on August 17, hours after Emirati guards fatally shot two Iranian fishermen and seized a boat and its crew for allegedly entering illegally the waters northwest of Sir Bu Nu’Ayr island. Although Abu Dhabi has not commented on the incidents, Iranian state media said that Emirati officials have since apologized and have freed the detained Iranian boat and its crew. The statement from Iran’s foreign ministry also said that the government had summoned the UAE charge d’affaires in Tehran, and that Abu Dhabi has agreed to compensate for any damages caused.



Assessment: The maritime boundaries between Iran and the UAE in the southern Persian Gulf are politically sensitive, if not disputed. Thus, contentious encounters involving fishing boats registered in the two countries are not uncommon. Still, the latest incidents come amid rising tensions between Tehran and Abu Dhabi following the latter’s decision to normalize relations with Israel, Iran’s arch-rival, last week. Thus, while the parties have traditionally maintained strong economic ties despite the UAE having downgraded its relations with Tehran in 2016 amid the Saudi-Iran rivalry, maritime incidents and other tit-for-tat diplomatic exchanges could become more frequent, especially if the so-called “Abraham Accord” between Abu Dhabi and Israel allows the latter to increase its political and commercial influence in the region. Indeed, Iranian President Hassan Rowhani has warned the UAE “against opening the path of Israel” to the Gulf, and while he did not elaborate further, officials in Abu Dhabi regarded the remarks as a threat.",thursday iran ’ foreign ministry said nation ’ coast guard detained united arab emirates-registered ship arrested crew allegedly violating country ’ territorial water according state medium detention occurred august 17 hour emirati guard fatally shot two iranian fisherman seized boat crew allegedly entering illegally water northwest sir bu nu ’ ayr island although abu dhabi commented incident iranian state medium said emirati official since apologized freed detained iranian boat crew statement iran ’ foreign ministry also said government summoned uae charge ’ affaire tehran abu dhabi agreed compensate damage caused assessment maritime boundary iran uae southern persian gulf politically sensitive disputed thus contentious encounter involving fishing boat registered two country uncommon still latest incident come amid rising tension tehran abu dhabi following latter ’ decision normalize relation israel iran ’ arch-rival last week thus party traditionally maintained strong economic tie despite uae downgraded relation tehran 2016 amid saudi-iran rivalry maritime incident tit-for-tat diplomatic exchange could become frequent especially so-called “ abraham accord ” abu dhabi israel allows latter increase political commercial influence region indeed iranian president hassan rowhani warned uae “ opening path israel ” gulf elaborate official abu dhabi regarded remark threat,"Maritime Advisory, Political Info / Event, Public Safety / Security, Military Operations",Administrative Issue

"A tornado outbreak occurred on Monday, December 16, across a portion of the Deep South, specifically in the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. At least 27 tornadoes were recorded in the three states according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Storm Prediction Center. The storm system has been blamed for at least three deaths, two in Alabama and one in Louisiana, directly from the tornadoes, as well as one other death in Kentucky that occurred during an attempted water rescue. Dozens of injuries, particularly in Louisiana and Mississippi were also blamed on the severe weather. A state of emergency (SOE) has been declared for Mississippi, which has seen damage from the tornadoes in at least 25 counties. 

Hundreds of structures in each of the affected states have been damaged or destroyed. In Louisiana, one of the worst tornadoes formed near DeRidder before traveling along an estimated 63-mile path northeast through Vernon and Rapides parishes including Alexandria. This tornado led the National Weather Service (NWS) to issue a tornado emergency alert for Alexandria and nearby Pineville. 

Assessment: The state of emergency declaration in Mississippi allows for additional state and potentially federal resources to help with rescue and recovery efforts in affected areas. In addition to the damage, the severe weather also led to power outages for upwards of 30,000 people across Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana; however, the majority of these have since been restored. A number of local roads across the region have been closed or were temporarily closed due to damage and debris on the roadways. 

The tornado emergency issued in Louisiana was the first issued by the NWS since the end of May when a 12-day tornado outbreak caused 300 tornadoes in 22 states leading to at least 14 deaths. Monday was also the first deaths blamed on tornadoes reported since that May tornado outbreak. While rarer in the winter, tornado outbreaks are still possible, especially in the southern United States, due to colder temperatures mixing with warmer temperatures leading to ideal tornado conditions. The severe weather risk has dissipated for Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama; however, tornado watches have been issued for portions of the Florida Panhandle, northeast Florida, and both southwest and southeast Georgia for Tuesday. Customers in affected areas are advised to use extreme caution and heed all instructions from local authorities. If a tornado warning is issued customers should seek shelter immediately and stay away from windows.","tornado outbreak occurred monday december 16 across portion deep south specifically state louisiana mississippi alabama least 27 tornado recorded three state according national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa storm prediction center storm system blamed least three death two alabama one louisiana directly tornado well one death kentucky occurred attempted water rescue dozen injury particularly louisiana mississippi also blamed severe weather state emergency soe declared mississippi seen damage tornado least 25 county hundred structure affected state damaged destroyed louisiana one worst tornado formed near deridder traveling along estimated 63-mile path northeast vernon rapides parish including alexandria tornado led national weather service nw issue tornado emergency alert alexandria nearby pineville assessment state emergency declaration mississippi allows additional state potentially federal resource help rescue recovery effort affected area addition damage severe weather also led power outage upwards 30,000 people across mississippi alabama louisiana however majority since restored number local road across region closed temporarily closed due damage debris roadway tornado emergency issued louisiana first issued nw since end may 12-day tornado outbreak caused 300 tornado 22 state leading least 14 death monday also first death blamed tornado reported since may tornado outbreak rarer winter tornado outbreak still possible especially southern united state due colder temperature mixing warmer temperature leading ideal tornado condition severe weather risk dissipated louisiana mississippi alabama however tornado watch issued portion florida panhandle northeast florida southwest southeast georgia tuesday customer affected area advised use extreme caution heed instruction local authority tornado warning issued customer seek shelter immediately stay away window",Weather Advisory,Weather

"On Thursday, media sources reported that the United States Navy has accused Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) of “dangerous and provocative actions” during an encounter in the Persian Gulf on April 15. According to the US Navy, 11 IRGC vessels approached six Navy and Coast Guard ships as they were conducting integration operations with army helicopters in international waters. At least one Iranian craft reportedly came within about 10 yards of a Coast Guard ship, while others crossed the bows and sterns of the American vessels at “extremely close range and high speeds.” The US ships reportedly issued several warnings through bridge-to-bridge radio, horn blasts, and long-range acoustic noise-making devices. The IRGC ships departed the area after roughly one hour. There were no reports of casualties in association with the incident.



Assessment: Wednesday’s incident occurred one day after suspected IRGC units boarded and briefly detained a Hong Kong-flagged oil tanker near the Strait of Hormuz, as well as episodes on April 2 and March 27, respectively, in which another tanker said it was approached by IRGC vessels and a US-flagged container ship was approached by two boats with a raised ladder. These encounters have been linked to the escalated regional tensions between Washington and Tehran, raising the possibility of additional incidents of this sort in the near- and medium-term future. A similar uptick in so-called Iranian harassment incidents involving US vessels occurred in the region in 2016-2017, and while provocative, none resulted in casualties or direct military confrontation, though the latter fired warning shots in a bid to ward off the IRGC craft on at least one occasion. Iran was also blamed for a series of indirect attacks on foreign tankers in the Gulf of Oman last summer. Indeed, Tehran is seen as keen on pushing back against the US and its Western allies over sanctions burdening its economy; however, it also likely wants to maintain plausible deniability in order to limit any escalation/retaliation. Thus, any future provocative activities by Iranian naval forces are unlikely to involve direct, overt military force, and the US-led International Maritime Security Construct group has said there is “no immediate threat to the free flow of shipping” in the Gulf following Wednesday’s contentious interaction.",thursday medium source reported united state navy accused iran ’ islamic revolution guard corp irgc “ dangerous provocative action ” encounter persian gulf april 15. according u navy 11 irgc vessel approached six navy coast guard ship conducting integration operation army helicopter international water least one iranian craft reportedly came within 10 yard coast guard ship others crossed bow stern american vessel “ extremely close range high speeds. ” u ship reportedly issued several warning bridge-to-bridge radio horn blast long-range acoustic noise-making device irgc ship departed area roughly one hour report casualty association incident assessment wednesday ’ incident occurred one day suspected irgc unit boarded briefly detained hong kong-flagged oil tanker near strait hormuz well episode april 2 march 27 respectively another tanker said approached irgc vessel us-flagged container ship approached two boat raised ladder encounter linked escalated regional tension washington tehran raising possibility additional incident sort near- medium-term future similar uptick so-called iranian harassment incident involving u vessel occurred region 2016-2017 provocative none resulted casualty direct military confrontation though latter fired warning shot bid ward irgc craft least one occasion iran also blamed series indirect attack foreign tanker gulf oman last summer indeed tehran seen keen pushing back u western ally sanction burdening economy however also likely want maintain plausible deniability order limit escalation/retaliation thus future provocative activity iranian naval force unlikely involve direct overt military force us-led international maritime security construct group said “ immediate threat free flow shipping ” gulf following wednesday ’ contentious interaction,"Maritime Advisory, Political Info / Event, Military Operations",Administrative Issue

"There were reports this week of power cuts or electricity restrictions in multiple parts of China, which began around the middle of December. Numerous cities have reportedly been affected in Guangdong, Hunan, Inner Mongolia, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and Zhejiang, with specific reports from Shenzhen in Guangdong, Changsha in Hunan, and Wenzhou and Yiwu in Zhejiang. While some areas of the aforementioned provinces and cities have seen power shutoffs, other restrictions that have been put in place by authorities in some locations include turning off street lights during some overnight hours, reducing manufacturing hours, and instructing businesses to not use heat or elevators. Authorities in Guangzhou blamed Monday power outages on an equipment issue and stated that there would be no power rationing in the city. Likewise, a planned outage announced for part of Shanghai on Tuesday was attributed to routine maintenance work by officials with the Shanghai Electric Power Company after online rumors that it was being implemented to conserve electricity. Utility officials stated that there was no shortage of energy in Shanghai.



Assessment: The power outages and various electricity restrictions are likely due to a combination of factors. In some regions, such as Hunan and Jiangxi, disruptions have been caused by an actual energy shortage, while in some other areas, notably Zhejiang, sources have reported that most restrictions have been ordered by local officials in order to meet energy conservation quotas before the end of the year. A number of businesses in Zhejiang have begun to purchase diesel generators in order to evade shutdowns of the power grid.



In regions experiencing legitimate energy shortages, outages and restrictions can be attributed to the brisk resumption of economic and industrial activity following COVID-19-related shutdowns earlier in the year, which has caused a rise in electricity consumption, a push by the central government away from fossil fuel-generated electricity toward more environmentally friendly production methods, such as hydropower, which are typically less productive at certain times of the year, and a coal shortage. Causes for China’s coal shortage include colder than expected winter temperatures in some regions, which have led to a spike in energy usage, shutdowns related to safety issues and accidents at various coal mines over the past several months, and disruptions to imported coal supplies. An ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in Mongolia was expected to cause some shortfall in coal exports to China due to difficulties for Mongolian workers in the coal industry traveling to their job sites and delays caused by virus testing and checks on shipments being brought across the Mongolia-China border. There were also restrictions placed on imports of coal earlier in the year in what was likely an attempt to protect domestic Chinese mines. These restrictions were reportedly lifted earlier this month for coal imports from most countries, but a semi-official block remains in place for imports of Australian coal, as China and Australia remain in a diplomatic dispute. As of Wednesday, dozens of cargo ships transporting up to US $500 million worth of Australian coal were continuing to wait off the Chinese coast, some of them having been seeking docking permission since June. More than 40 percent of China’s coking coal imports and 25 percent of its thermal coal imports in 2019 were from Australia, with at least three percent of the total thermal coal used in China annually being Australian. While the ban on Australian coal imports is unlikely to be entirely responsible for China’s current energy shortages, the country’s usual imports from Australia are significant enough that the block has likely contributed to the energy shortfall to some degree, and Chinese state media outlets have reportedly been instructed not to tie the current outages to the ban on Australian imports. If China were to reverse its current block on Australian coal and unload the ships waiting off its coast, it could help to alleviate the present energy concerns to a certain extent, especially in southern provinces, which are historically more dependent on coal from Australia. Regardless, however, some outages and related restrictions on energy usage are likely to persist into the spring in some regions, given the uptick in manufacturing China has seen recently and the unusually cold weather in some provinces. Individuals and businesses are advised of the likelihood of related electricity disruptions in certain areas.",report week power cut electricity restriction multiple part china began around middle december numerous city reportedly affected guangdong hunan inner mongolia jiangxi shaanxi zhejiang specific report shenzhen guangdong changsha hunan wenzhou yiwu zhejiang area aforementioned province city seen power shutoffs restriction put place authority location include turning street light overnight hour reducing manufacturing hour instructing business use heat elevator authority guangzhou blamed monday power outage equipment issue stated would power rationing city likewise planned outage announced part shanghai tuesday attributed routine maintenance work official shanghai electric power company online rumor implemented conserve electricity utility official stated shortage energy shanghai assessment power outage various electricity restriction likely due combination factor region hunan jiangxi disruption caused actual energy shortage area notably zhejiang source reported restriction ordered local official order meet energy conservation quota end year number business zhejiang begun purchase diesel generator order evade shutdown power grid region experiencing legitimate energy shortage outage restriction attributed brisk resumption economic industrial activity following covid-19-related shutdown earlier year caused rise electricity consumption push central government away fossil fuel-generated electricity toward environmentally friendly production method hydropower typically le productive certain time year coal shortage cause china ’ coal shortage include colder expected winter temperature region led spike energy usage shutdown related safety issue accident various coal mine past several month disruption imported coal supply ongoing covid-19 outbreak mongolia expected cause shortfall coal export china due difficulty mongolian worker coal industry traveling job site delay caused virus testing check shipment brought across mongolia-china border also restriction placed import coal earlier year likely attempt protect domestic chinese mine restriction reportedly lifted earlier month coal import country semi-official block remains place import australian coal china australia remain diplomatic dispute wednesday dozen cargo ship transporting u 500 million worth australian coal continuing wait chinese coast seeking docking permission since june 40 percent china ’ coking coal import 25 percent thermal coal import 2019 australia least three percent total thermal coal used china annually australian ban australian coal import unlikely entirely responsible china ’ current energy shortage country ’ usual import australia significant enough block likely contributed energy shortfall degree chinese state medium outlet reportedly instructed tie current outage ban australian import china reverse current block australian coal unload ship waiting coast could help alleviate present energy concern certain extent especially southern province historically dependent coal australia regardless however outage related restriction energy usage likely persist spring region given uptick manufacturing china seen recently unusually cold weather province individual business advised likelihood related electricity disruption certain area,"Regulatory Advisory, Political Info / Event, Network Disruption",Administrative Issue

"On Monday, media sources reported that Turkish police blocked a protest by pro-Kurdish activists in Istanbul. According to reports, the demonstration was called to show support for Peoples  Democratic Party (HDP) legislator Leyla G ven, who has been observing a hunger strike since November to demand better conditions for jailed Kurdistan Workers  Party (PKK) leader Abdullah  calan. Approximately 40 activists attempted to march from  stiklal Avenue to Taksim Square, but were dispersed by riot police after staging a brief sit-in. There were no initial reports of significant violence or other disturbances. G ven was released from jail last month amid a deterioration of her health; however, she has maintained her hunger strike, subsisting only on sugared or salted water. More than 250 Kurdish inmates and other political prisoners in 36 detention facilities across Turkey are also observing a hunger strike in solidarity with G ven.

"On Thursday, it was reported that the Mundra Port and Kandla Port in Gujarat State have been put on high alert due to a potential terror threat. The alert originated from intelligence agencies regarding the possibility that Pakistan-trained commandos had infiltrated the Gulf of Kutch after two single-engine Pakistani boats were found in the Harami Nala area. The ports have instructed shipping agents and vessels to report any suspicious activity to the Coast Guard or other authorities at the ports. Security at the ports has also been increased, although there were no initial reports of disruptions to maritime shipping. Around 60 personnel have been deployed at checkpoints at ports, who are also equipped with devices to puncture the tires of vehicles that may attempt to break through barriers. Around 100 Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) commandos have also been deployed to the Nayara Energy oil refinery in the Vadinagar area of Gujarat.

Assessment: The alert on Thursday followed reports earlier in the week from Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh, who said that the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) militant group was training individuals to carry out underwater attacks. Admiral Singh said that the navy was fully prepared to foil such attacks. Reports about Pakistan s military training JeM divers to carry out attacks are not new and have been mentioned last year and the year before, although the targets were reportedly Indian Navy vessels. It remains questionable that JeM has the capabilities to carry out that kind of underwater attack, as they have not displayed similar capabilities in the past. In addition, there are a multitude of easier methods to carry out an attack on port facilities that do not involve underwater diving training and the transportation and use of more advanced explosives. It is also important to note that Indian intelligence agencies issue hundreds of alerts every year, with the vast majority not resulting in an attack.

"Industry sources indicate on March 5 that as the Coronavirus outbreak spreads beyond China, port operations globally remain normal, except for Wuhan’s barge service. Carriers have announced numerous blank sailings in the past weeks, and new cancellations are being made by the carriers without the usual notice periods. This has created equipment imbalances that are now impacting equipment capacity globally. Carriers are reporting reefer plug shortages in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Ningbo. The situation is expected to return to normal once factories in China resume their production, and high demand for space and equipment will cause a further increase in capacity shortages. As a ripple effect, the blank voyages from China will likely cause reefer equipment shortages in other geographical regions, as the evacuation of empty equipment will take time. Full reefer containers would need to be unloaded first before they could be returned to demand areas, which will take another 3-6 weeks, depending on the geography. As a result, freight rates are expected to spike. The prolonged container turnaround due to the backlog at Chinese ports will also impact equipment availability in the other regions. Some carriers have taken idling vessels on-hire to extend the reefer plug capability in Shanghai, using these vessels as additional storage. No forecasts can be made about when the situation will improve.",industry source indicate march 5 coronavirus outbreak spread beyond china port operation globally remain normal except wuhan ’ barge service carrier announced numerous blank sailing past week new cancellation made carrier without usual notice period created equipment imbalance impacting equipment capacity globally carrier reporting reefer plug shortage shanghai tianjin ningbo situation expected return normal factory china resume production high demand space equipment cause increase capacity shortage ripple effect blank voyage china likely cause reefer equipment shortage geographical region evacuation empty equipment take time full reefer container would need unloaded first could returned demand area take another 3-6 week depending geography result freight rate expected spike prolonged container turnaround due backlog chinese port also impact equipment availability region carrier taken idling vessel on-hire extend reefer plug capability shanghai using vessel additional storage forecast made situation improve,Cargo Disruption,Administrative Issue

"On Monday, authorities announced that pirates kidnapped five Chinese sailors off the coast of Nigeria. According to a statement from the Chinese foreign ministry, pirates attacked an unidentified Singapore cargo ship last Thursday, July 2, at an unspecified location in Nigerian waters. Five Chinese sailors were kidnapped, but no further details were immediately provided. Maritime security monitor Dryad Global identified the attacked vessel as Kota Budi and stated that it was targeted off the coast of Benin.



Assessment: The attack was the second kidnapping off the coast of Nigeria last Thursday alone and brings the number of people kidnapped in the Gulf of Guinea – which spans 3,500 miles from the coast of Senegal to Angola – to nearly 65 so far this year, according to the International Maritime Bureau. However, Dryad Global has put the number of kidnappings in the Gulf of Guinea at 78 so far this year, marking a 26 percent increase compared to the same time period last year. Due to the high threat from piracy, seafarers are advised to reconsider the need to sail in the Gulf of Guinea, including off the coast of Nigeria. Those continuing to operate in the area are urged to exercise a high level of vigilance at all times and ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to deter potential attackers.","monday authority announced pirate kidnapped five chinese sailor coast nigeria according statement chinese foreign ministry pirate attacked unidentified singapore cargo ship last thursday july 2 unspecified location nigerian water five chinese sailor kidnapped detail immediately provided maritime security monitor dryad global identified attacked vessel kota budi stated targeted coast benin assessment attack second kidnapping coast nigeria last thursday alone brings number people kidnapped gulf guinea – span 3,500 mile coast senegal angola – nearly 65 far year according international maritime bureau however dryad global put number kidnapping gulf guinea 78 far year marking 26 percent increase compared time period last year due high threat piracy seafarer advised reconsider need sail gulf guinea including coast nigeria continuing operate area urged exercise high level vigilance time ensure appropriate security measure place deter potential attacker","Kidnap / Detention, Maritime Advisory",Terrorism

"Risks: Labour strikes; Protests and riots Sectors or assets affected: Tourism; Restaurants; Telecommunications; EducationOn 20 September 2018, striking hotel workers from seven hotels in Chicago agreed to terms with Marriott International, ending a two-week strike. The hotel workers, organised by the UNITE HERE Local 1 union, sought wage increases, year-round health insurance coverage for workers laid-off during slower seasons, pensions, additional sick leave, and improved workloads. Hotel workers representing 19 additional Chicago hotels are continuing their strike, begun 7 September against various other locally operating, international hotel chains. On 17 September, UNITE HERE hotel workers in Detroit voted to authorise a strike action against Marriott, seeking similar terms to the Chicago strikers. This follows similar votes by UNITE HERE hotel workers in Boston, Hawaii, Oakland, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, and Seattle. Although the strikes have spread nationwide, none of them have been violent or led to damage to properties. Furthermore, none of the individual unions have called for violence. Significance: Although most hotel operators insisted that disruptions have been minimal, there have been various media reports suggesting long check-in delays, disruptions to cleaning services, and the closure of hotel restaurants. Furthermore, two political organisations, the Democratic Attorneys General Association and the LGBTQ Health Symposium, cancelled their Chicago events in support of the strikers. Chicago's city-wide hotel strikes, the largest of their kind since 1903, represent the latest in a growing trend of work stoppages, including those involving prisoners, telecommunications workers, and teachers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of major work stoppages nationwide involving 1,000 workers or more had fallen from approximately 350 annually in the 1970s to seven in 2017. However, per a report by Jacobin magazine, this number has more than doubled to 16 during 2018. With unemployment at 3.8%, replacing striking workers is difficult for firms. Thus, many of the strikes, as seen in the hotel example above, have been successful and will probably provide an impetus for other employees nationwide in sectors like tourism, telecommunications, fast-food, and education. Most notably, UNITE HERE appears to have prepared well, by increasing dues prior to the action so that they could provide strike wages during the impasse. There is no precedent of notable violence during such strikes and there is no evidence to suggest this will change in the coming months. However, they are likely to last weeks or months, as shown in previous strikes with telecom firms and schools, severely disrupting business operations. Indeed, statements by the hotel union suggested that they were willing to strike months to obtain a favourable resolution to their demands. Any delay in Marriott opening negotiations with hotel workers in cities that have already authorised but not yet commenced striking would increase the likelihood of strikes in these locations, as the hotel chain has already demonstrated a willingness to address strikers' contract demands.

"The August 4 explosion in Beirut, Lebanon, has caused individuals in multiple countries in Asia to express concern about large quantities of ammonium nitrate, the substance believed to have triggered the blast, within their own borders. In India, officials have confirmed in recent days that 700 tons of ammonium nitrate have been stored at a port in the southern city of Chennai since 2015. According to reports, the substance was imported from South Korea to be used in fertilizers but was confiscated after it was found to be weapon-grade. Local customs officials have said that the chemicals currently present no threat to the public and that they will soon be sold at auction.



Likewise, residents in and around Newcastle, Australia, have called for the relocation of between 6,000 and 12,000 tons of ammonium nitrate stored at a nearby plant belonging to the chemical manufacturer Orica. The stockpile, possibly more than three-times the size of that in Beirut, is said to be housed in warehouses situated within a half mile of residences and less than two miles from the central business district. Although Orica officials have said the storage of the ammonium nitrate is strictly regulated, audited, and secured, residents have said that an explosion would be powerful enough to level Newcastle, killing and injuring many people.



Ammonium nitrate is an odorless crystalline salt often used in the production of fertilizer. When combined with fuel oils, it creates a potent explosive widely used in the construction industry, as well as for quarrying. However, it has also been used for nefarious purposes, notably the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, and also been the cause of numerous industrial explosions across the globe.



Assessment: Based on the information available, the August 4 explosion in Beirut appears to have been the result of gross negligence by Lebanese authorities. Despite repeated warnings for it to be removed, the large quantity of ammonium nitrate had been stored improperly for years, without proper ventilation and near other combustible materials and/or potential sources of ignition. Although it is unclear, if not unlikely, that the stockpiles in Chennai and Newcastle are being stored under similar conditions, especially in the latter, Tuesday’s explosion in Beirut has nonetheless caused concern over the potentially catastrophic consequences of any accident despite the lower risk. Individuals and firms dealing with ammonium nitrate are urged to ensure that storage conditions are inspected regularly, and that security arrangements and emergency response procedures are reviewed, assessed, and rehearsed.","august 4 explosion beirut lebanon caused individual multiple country asia express concern large quantity ammonium nitrate substance believed triggered blast within border india official confirmed recent day 700 ton ammonium nitrate stored port southern city chennai since 2015. according report substance imported south korea used fertilizer confiscated found weapon-grade local custom official said chemical currently present threat public soon sold auction likewise resident around newcastle australia called relocation 6,000 12,000 ton ammonium nitrate stored nearby plant belonging chemical manufacturer orica stockpile possibly three-times size beirut said housed warehouse situated within half mile residence le two mile central business district although orica official said storage ammonium nitrate strictly regulated audited secured resident said explosion would powerful enough level newcastle killing injuring many people ammonium nitrate odorless crystalline salt often used production fertilizer combined fuel oil creates potent explosive widely used construction industry well quarrying however also used nefarious purpose notably 1995 oklahoma city bombing also cause numerous industrial explosion across globe assessment based information available august 4 explosion beirut appears result gross negligence lebanese authority despite repeated warning removed large quantity ammonium nitrate stored improperly year without proper ventilation near combustible material and/or potential source ignition although unclear unlikely stockpile chennai newcastle stored similar condition especially latter tuesday ’ explosion beirut nonetheless caused concern potentially catastrophic consequence accident despite lower risk individual firm dealing ammonium nitrate urged ensure storage condition inspected regularly security arrangement emergency response procedure reviewed assessed rehearsed","Hazmat Response, Public Safety / Security",Terrorism

"Federal Reserve (“Fed”) Vice-Chair Randal Quarles announced on 10 November that the Federal Reserve has applied to join the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). Quarles stated that he expected membership to be granted and that “we could probably join before the spring”. NGFS describes itself as a “fast growing international network of central banks and supervisors” targeting “greening the financial system” and to strengthen efforts to meet climate goals, including management of climate risks and mobilisng capital for environmentally positive investments. Its website notes that over “80 central banks, supervisors and other competent authorities have joined” since NGFS was established in 2017, with newer members including Abu Dhabi, Brazil, Canada, Indonesia, Russia, and South Korea.  Significance: The Fed’s application to NGFS and other recent statements it has made indicate growing US regulatory focus on the impacts of climate risks on its financial system. It is hard to envisage NGFS rejecting prompt entry of the United States, with its entry helping it to participate in applying, developing and expanding existing climate-related financial sector regulation, potentially within the six-month outlook. Growing US regulatory focus on climate issues affecting financial institutions was reinforced by a recent statement by Fed Chair Jerome Powell that within the Fed’s remit, “We will account for all material risks”, seeking seek to protect the economy and the public from them, noting specifically that “climate change is one of those risks”. In its latest Financial Stability Report, released on 9 November, the Fed signalled “acute hazards, such as storms, floods, droughts or wildfires” as having scope to cause rapid changes in asset valuations, further noting that chronic issues, like rising sea levels, also have major repricing and risk implications. Having been a relatively “late starter”, prompt US moves to align with wider international financial-sector regulatory standards addressing climate issues are likely. Under the next US administration, key indicators of toughening policy would include early introduction of additional requirements for financial institutions regarding internal assessment and management of climate risk, increased climate-focused disclosure and climate-related stress testing.  A further indicator will be changes in the composition of the Fed itself with new, more climate-focused appointees (see United States: 10 November 2020: Likely policy changes in a Biden administration with Republican control of the Senate).Risks: Regulatory burdenSectors or assets affected: Financial sector&copy; 2020, IHS Markit Inc.

Demonstrations have been occurring on a near-daily basis against an October 22 Constitutional Tribunal ruling banning abortion in almost all circumstances. Protests, roadblocks, and strikes by up to hundreds of thousands of people were reported in city centers countrywide, including Warsaw, Gdansk, Lodz, Krakow, Poznan, Wroclaw, Szczecin, and Katowice. 

Popular protest sites in Warsaw include the Sejm, Constitutional Tribunal on al. Jana Chrystiana Szucha, Plac Zbawiciela, plac Unii Lubelskiej, the Law and Justice (PiS) party headquarters on Nowogrodzka Street, PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski’s house on Mickiewicza street in the Zoliborz area, and the prime minister’s villa on Parkowa Street, as well as PiS offices and public spaces in city centers elsewhere. Activists also called for protesters to spread out to smaller cities and towns. 

The police previously used crowd control measures including tear gas and water cannons against protesters, prompting activism against alleged incidents of police violence. Counter-protests are possible, and clashes involving anti-abortion protesters, pro-abortion counter-protesters, and the police cannot be ruled out.

"On Wednesday, Manila Water announced that it was implementing a revised water interruption program in the Metro Manila area and Rizal Province to deal with insufficient water supplies. Customers may experience between six and 21 hours of service interruptions, while water pressure may be lower than usual. The water interruptions will be first impacting the East Zone of Metro Manila, including the Makati, Mandaluyong, Pasig, Pateros, San Juan, Taguig, and Marikina areas, parts of Quezon City and Manila, as well as the Angono and Antipolo areas of Rizal Province. 
 
	 
		Assessment: The water restriction program is expected to last for the next three months or until the rainy season begins. The dry season typically ends in May, but has been extended due to the El Nino weather phenomenon. El Nino is one of the causes of the recent shortage, but another main cause is a significant increase in demand. Manila Water has said that it will prioritize hospitals and school areas, while water tankers would be provided to households and commercial establishments.

"With Mongolia’s COVID-19 lockdown expected to remain in place at least into December, there is the potential for disruptions to coal exports to China, although no major shortages or difficulties have been immediately reported. Some Mongolian-Russian border checkpoints have faced intermittent closures since Mongolia’s virus cases are believed to have originated from a truck driver arriving from Russia, but border crossings with China have remained open to freight shipments. There have been conflicting statements from Chinese government and electricity officials on the status of China’s coal availability in recent weeks. According to the government’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), both coal and natural gas supplies in China are currently enough for winter energy needs; however, an official with the state-affiliated China Electricity Council (CEC) was quoted in media reports last month, before Mongolia’s COVID-19 outbreak, as saying that China’s coal supply for the winter was likely to be more strained than in any year since 2016. 



Assessment: The majority of Mongolia’s coal exports go to China, and shipments to China have increased further in recent months following a block on Chinese imports of coal from Australia. The ban on Australian coal has likely been related to diplomatic disputes with Canberra, and an attempt to protect the domestic Chinese coal mining industry. China’s own coal production has also been hampered this year by safety inspections in some provinces following various mining incidents. If it became necessary, China could relax its block on Australian coal and unload the up to two million tons of coal that was waiting on ships stalled off the coast of Tangshan as of last week, but it would likely take longer for Beijing to be able to resume regular imports of Australian coal following the block. At this point, there remains no indication of imminent coal shortages in China due to the Mongolian lockdown. As it is currently implemented, Mongolia’s lockdown is not expected to affect production but could potentially lead to disruptions for coal workers attempting to travel to their job sites. It is advised to follow developments, however, as energy needs spike during the winter, and the possibility of coal disruptions remains depending upon the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak in Mongolia.",mongolia ’ covid-19 lockdown expected remain place least december potential disruption coal export china although major shortage difficulty immediately reported mongolian-russian border checkpoint faced intermittent closure since mongolia ’ virus case believed originated truck driver arriving russia border crossing china remained open freight shipment conflicting statement chinese government electricity official status china ’ coal availability recent week according government ’ national development reform commission ndrc coal natural gas supply china currently enough winter energy need however official state-affiliated china electricity council cec quoted medium report last month mongolia ’ covid-19 outbreak saying china ’ coal supply winter likely strained year since 2016. assessment majority mongolia ’ coal export go china shipment china increased recent month following block chinese import coal australia ban australian coal likely related diplomatic dispute canberra attempt protect domestic chinese coal mining industry china ’ coal production also hampered year safety inspection province following various mining incident became necessary china could relax block australian coal unload two million ton coal waiting ship stalled coast tangshan last week would likely take longer beijing able resume regular import australian coal following block point remains indication imminent coal shortage china due mongolian lockdown currently implemented mongolia ’ lockdown expected affect production could potentially lead disruption coal worker attempting travel job site advised follow development however energy need spike winter possibility coal disruption remains depending upon progression covid-19 outbreak mongolia,"Regulatory Advisory, Ground Transportation Advisory, Public Health Advisory, Network Disruption",Administrative Issue

"On Thursday, Uber and Cabify announced that they are halting operations indefinitely in Barcelona from Friday, February 1, though UberEats would continue to function. The cessation of services by the ride-hailing platforms is in response to the passage of a regulation in Catalonia requiring hired cars be booked at least 15 minutes in advance of a pickup time. Uber criticized the regulation, contending that the mandated 15-minute waiting period for a VTC (private-hire vehicle with driver) is not required anywhere else in Europe. Uber and Cabify estimated that more than 3,500 people will lose employment as a result of the new regulations. 
 
	Assessment: The regulations effectively forcing out the two ride-hailing services from Catalonia follow on protests by both taxi drivers and VTC drivers in Barcelona and Madrid. Taxi drivers have argued that less regulated drivers with platforms such as Uber and Cabify, which may offer cheaper fares, posed unfair competition to licensed taxi drivers. Within Barcelona, Cabify alone had about one million users, and said some 98.5 percent of rides were ordered in less than 15 minutes  notice. The extent of impacts to customers and the transport sector in Catalonia remains to be seen. Officials in Madrid have indicated that they do not plan on adopting regulations similar to those passed in Barcelona, and taxi drivers in Madrid have continued strikes and demonstrations, including disruptive blockades around the capital. Resilience360 customers in Catalonia are advised to plan accordingly when arranging transportation due to the newly mandated 15-minute booking notice and it is recommended to avoid any associated demonstration activity due to the risk of confrontations or other incidents of unrest.","thursday uber cabify announced halting operation indefinitely barcelona friday february 1 though ubereats would continue function cessation service ride-hailing platform response passage regulation catalonia requiring hired car booked least 15 minute advance pickup time uber criticized regulation contending mandated 15-minute waiting period vtc private-hire vehicle driver required anywhere else europe uber cabify estimated 3,500 people lose employment result new regulation assessment regulation effectively forcing two ride-hailing service catalonia follow protest taxi driver vtc driver barcelona madrid taxi driver argued le regulated driver platform uber cabify may offer cheaper fare posed unfair competition licensed taxi driver within barcelona cabify alone one million user said 98.5 percent ride ordered le 15 minute notice extent impact customer transport sector catalonia remains seen official madrid indicated plan adopting regulation similar passed barcelona taxi driver madrid continued strike demonstration including disruptive blockade around capital resilience360 customer catalonia advised plan accordingly arranging transportation due newly mandated 15-minute booking notice recommended avoid associated demonstration activity due risk confrontation incident unrest",Miscellaneous Events,Others

"A large fire continues to burn at the Intercontinental Terminals Company (ITC) along the Houston Ship Channel in La Porte, TX on Monday. The fire initially began on Sunday, March 17 in a storage tank containing naphtha, a volatile chemical that is used in the making of gasoline. Overnight the fire spread to several other tanks and as of this writing at least six tanks remain involved in the fire. The majority of the tanks contain naphtha and xylene, a similar chemical used in the making of gasoline, and one of the tanks involved contained Toluene which is used in nail polish removed and paint thinner. Three tanks are believed to be near containment. There have been no reports of injuries or widespread evacuations. Highway 225, which runs near the facility, was temporarily closed in both directions but reopened on Monday morning. 
 
	Assessment: Officials expect the fire to burn for at least two more days before being fully contained but believe the threat of explosions is minimal. Moreover, a shelter-in-place that was issued for residents in nearby Deer Park has since been lifted. Officials in Deer Park and La Porte suspended school on Monday and asked employees not to report to work as a precaution. The fire has not yet caused any disruptions to the Port of Houston or shipping traffic in the 50-mile-long channel. The channel links refineries and chemical plants such as ITC in Houston and Texas City to the Gulf of Mexico. The fire is also not causing disruptions to the nearby Royal Dutch Shell refinery in Deer Park. The U.S. Coast Guard has restricted access to the docks at ITC terminal as well as the nearby Vopak terminal. Officials have conducted air emissions tests and found the presence of volatile organic compounds over six miles away from the fire; however, those levels are not considered  hazardous .

"On Sunday, around 200 protesters gathered near the Fai Ming Estate on Wah Ming Road in the New Territories area of Hong Kong. Protesters blocked roads and clashed with police during the evening. Petrol bombs were thrown at the Sing Fai House and Tai Fai House of the Fai Ming Estate, causing damage to the lobby areas. The protest was a direct response to the government announcing that it would use the Fai Ming Estate as a temporary quarantine area for those displaying symptoms of the Wuhan coronavirus (2019-nCoV) or their close contacts. The government later reversed their decision and said that they would halt preparatory work on the estate. Clashes between protesters and police also took place on both Saturday and Sunday in the Mong Kok area of Kowloon, with police using tear gas after protesters threw objects. The protests in Mong Kok were to mark the start of the  fishball revolution  in 2016, which also took place during the Lunar New Year.

On Monday, a small explosive device was detonated at around 2:45 AM local time in a stall of the men s restroom at Caritas Medical Centre, located in the Cheung Sha Wan area of Kowloon. The blast did not cause any injuries and only damaged the toilet. Within a few hours of the explosion, a post on the Telegram encrypted messaging app said that it was meant as a warning and that  there will be more real bombs to come.  The message also demanded that Hong Kong be sealed off from mainland China due to 2019-nCoV outbreak and that medical workers should go on strike immediately. Police have not made any arrests in connection with the explosion and the authenticity of the message has not been verified. The device has been described as a small explosive and used a glass bottle, a battery, and wires.

Assessment:  The protest at the Fai Ming Estate and in Mong Kok over the weekend highlight the continued persistence of Hong Kong s protest movement. Mong Kok continues to be one of the biggest hotspots for protests in Hong Kong and the fact that violent clashes took place there over the weekend was not a surprise. The police had rejected permission for a rally on Sunday to mark the fishball revolution, but the protests and clashes demonstrate that even without police authorization, individuals are likely to gather anyway. 

The Fai Ming protest and the explosion at the Caritas Medical Centre also suggest that protesters are willing to use the coronavirus outbreak to give additional strength to their movement. The demands to shut down entry to Hong Kong from mainland Chinese residents to protect against the outbreak aligns with protesters  general feelings that they are being displaced by mainland Chinese residents as a way for Beijing to increase its influence. Another rally to protest the government s response to the outbreak is scheduled for Friday, January 31, at Salisbury Garden in Tsim Sha Tsui. The explosive device placed at Caritas Medical Centre, if it was actually placed by a protester, appears to have been really meant as a warning, given that it was not a powerful bomb and it exploded in a confined area and at a time where it would not likely have caused casualties. However, there is still a risk that hospitals or other healthcare centers could be targeted in the future and travelers are advised to exercise a heightened level of situational awareness and report any suspicious objects to local authorities.",sunday around 200 protester gathered near fai ming estate wah ming road new territory area hong kong protester blocked road clashed police evening petrol bomb thrown sing fai house tai fai house fai ming estate causing damage lobby area protest direct response government announcing would use fai ming estate temporary quarantine area displaying symptom wuhan coronavirus 2019-ncov close contact government later reversed decision said would halt preparatory work estate clash protester police also took place saturday sunday mong kok area kowloon police using tear gas protester threw object protest mong kok mark start fishball revolution 2016 also took place lunar new year monday small explosive device detonated around 2:45 local time stall men restroom caritas medical centre located cheung sha wan area kowloon blast cause injury damaged toilet within hour explosion post telegram encrypted messaging app said meant warning real bomb come message also demanded hong kong sealed mainland china due 2019-ncov outbreak medical worker go strike immediately police made arrest connection explosion authenticity message verified device described small explosive used glass bottle battery wire assessment protest fai ming estate mong kok weekend highlight continued persistence hong kong protest movement mong kok continues one biggest hotspot protest hong kong fact violent clash took place weekend surprise police rejected permission rally sunday mark fishball revolution protest clash demonstrate even without police authorization individual likely gather anyway fai ming protest explosion caritas medical centre also suggest protester willing use coronavirus outbreak give additional strength movement demand shut entry hong kong mainland chinese resident protect outbreak aligns protester general feeling displaced mainland chinese resident way beijing increase influence another rally protest government response outbreak scheduled friday january 31 salisbury garden tsim sha tsui explosive device placed caritas medical centre actually placed protester appears really meant warning given powerful bomb exploded confined area time would likely caused casualty however still risk hospital healthcare center could targeted future traveler advised exercise heightened level situational awareness report suspicious object local authority,Protest / Riot,Worker Strike

"Updated media sources indicated on January 14 that a fresh round of talks is scheduled to take place between labour union Unite and Hutchison Ports at the Port of Felixstowe on January 16 after union members decisively voted in favour of strike action. 

Initially, around 116 engineering workers were planning to go on strike just before Christmas due to a dispute about planned outsourcing of jobs to Universal Tyres but strike action was averted after union Unite and Port of Felixstowe officials held discussions - involving independent arbitration service Acas - and agreed that no deal with a new tyre company would be signed until alternative arrangements were discussed in January.

Plans for a strike have since spread to the rest of the workforce after Unite decided to ballot the rest of its 1,800 members on the possibility of industrial action as the union fears that the outsourcing of jobs to Universal Tyre would only be the beginning of a bigger trend. The ballot opened on December 24 and closed on January 14.

The union has so far declined to provide any further information until negotiations are completed.","updated medium source indicated january 14 fresh round talk scheduled take place labour union unite hutchison port port felixstowe january 16 union member decisively voted favour strike action initially around 116 engineering worker planning go strike christmas due dispute planned outsourcing job universal tyre strike action averted union unite port felixstowe official held discussion involving independent arbitration service acas agreed deal new tyre company would signed alternative arrangement discussed january plan strike since spread rest workforce unite decided ballot rest 1,800 member possibility industrial action union fear outsourcing job universal tyre would beginning bigger trend ballot opened december 24 closed january 14. union far declined provide information negotiation completed",Port Strike,Worker Strike

"Hurricane Dorian continues to move through the Atlantic Ocean as it passes Puerto Rico and heads toward the eastern Florida coast. The storm is expected to strengthen over the next days and is forecast to make landfall as a major Category 3 storm, on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, late Sunday night or early Monday morning. Significant uncertainty remains on the path of Dorian; however, as of Wednesday afternoon the projected path has the storm making landfall near Orlando, FL and the Florida Space Coast. Portions of Florida and other parts of the southeastern coast are expected to receive between four to eight inches of rain with some areas receiving upwards of ten inches. Tropical-storm-force winds will reach the Florida coast by Saturday. Governor Ron DeSantis has issued a state of emergency for the state of Florida in anticipation of the storm.

Assessment: The state of emergency declaration allows for preemptive planning coordination of resources across Florida to help with preparation and eventual recovery efforts. Governor DeSantis has also urged Florida residents to have seven days of supplies and an emergency plan in case of disaster as the hurricane continues to near the state. While the path of the storm remains uncertain, Dorian making landfall as a Category 3 storm will likely cause significant disruptions across Florida. These may include evacuations, widespread power outages, road closures, and life-threatening flooding conditions. The U.S. Coast Guard has set a number of Florida ports at port condition Whiskey including Key West, Miami, Port Canaveral, Tampa, St Petersburg, and Manatee. Port condition Whiskey means that ports remain open to all commercial and cargo operations; however, commercial vessels greater than 500 gross tons should begin making plans to depart the port. It is likely as the storm nears that a number of these ports will close due to the anticipated high winds. 

Travelers should also anticipate air travel delays across the Southeast, especially for Florida airports as well as Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), a major hub for both domestic and international flights. Additionally, several projections have the storm either moving across Florida into the Gulf of Mexico, potentially creating disruptions for the Gulf Coast or have the storm moving up the southeast coast where disruptions would occur in Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.

"Following the passage of legislation for the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the UK will be leaving the EU at 11:00 PM London time on Friday, January 31. Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans an address to the nation on the evening of Brexit, and a celebratory event will be held at Parliament Square in Westminster on Friday evening. On the same evening, protests are planned in Edinburgh outside the Scottish parliament, with several thousand expected to attend. Government targets for trade talks are planned to be published following Brexit, as the UK enters a post-Brexit transition period. The transition, during which the UK will maintain current trade and travel relations and continues to follow EU rules, is currently planned to conclude on December 31, 2020.

Assessment: While the forthcoming separation from the EU was effectively confirmed with the sweeping Conservative victory in December s snap general election, the nature of the UK s future relationship with the EU and countries around the world remains largely to be clarified. In addition to seeking at least a baseline agreement with the EU by the end of this year to avoid another form of the so-called Brexit where separation occurs with no arrangement, the US has said it is hoping to strike a trade deal with the UK this year. While key agreements are likely to materialize in some form before the transition period concludes, without necessarily being as comprehensive as current relations facilitate, the British government faces considerable challenges in attempting to negotiate multiple major agreements on future relations with individual countries and blocs worldwide. Furthermore, divisions persist within the UK over Brexit; in the coming weeks and months, those divisions may manifest as protest activity around Brexit-related activities and in response to associated political developments. As well as political protests that often convene in London around parliament and Trafalgar Square, demonstrations are likely around Scotland, Northern Ireland, and other locations that voted to remain in the EU. Confrontations and clashes between opposing groups remain a risk at such events, including those involving unionist and republican entities. Customers are advised to continue monitoring developments related to the UK s post-Brexit relationships and to anticipate possible localized disruptions as well as exercising caution around any associated protest activity.

"On Monday, media sources reported that police had begun to deploy officers in preparation for the upcoming inaugural ceremony of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge, which will be held in Zhuhai, in China s southern province of Guangdong. The grand opening, which will be attended by Chinese President Xi Jinping, will take place on the morning of Tuesday, October 23rd. The bridge will open to vehicular traffic the following day. Over 500 police officers and more than 20 police boats have been mobilized for the event. Furthermore, observation posts have been established along on Lantau Island.

"When Cyclone Fani hit last week, heavy rain and winds of up to 127 mph swept through the coastal areas of India’s Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and West Bengal States and low-lying coastal areas of Bangladesh. Operations at seaports, land, and air services were halted in both countries. Cyclone Fani, equivalent to a category 4 storm (the second-highest on a five-tier Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale), made landfall on May 3 in Puri, Odisha and weakened into a tropical depression by the time it entered Bangladesh. 

Although the cyclone resulted in fewer casualties and lesser damages to infrastructure than initially anticipated, residual disruptions can be expected in the affected regions at least until May 10. While commercial flights have resumed at Biju Patnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar, delays and cancellations are likely to persist in the coming days after hundreds of flights from both private and national airlines were cancelled prior to the storm. Additionally, a total of 370 trains were cancelled in India though limited rail services have resumed to and from Bhubaneswar on May 5. Services in Puri are also expected to resume in the coming days.
Power outages were reported in several districts in Odisha, as 3,000,000 customers were without electricity, after strong winds uprooted communication and power lines during the cyclone passage, damaging about 10,000 poles in Bhubaneswar alone. Electricity is gradually being restored in Balasore, Bhadrak, Keonjhar, and Mayurbhanj as of May 5, while some parts of Bhubaneswar are expected to receive full power supply in the coming days. Authorities in Puri stated that they were targeting to restore electricity for 1,000,000 customers on May 6.

In anticipation of the cyclone’s impact, seaports located along the Indian eastern coastal line including Paradip, Gopalpur, Dhamra, Visakhapatnam, and Kolkata Port Trust temporarily suspended operations for 24 to 48-hours before May 3. In Bangladesh, Chittagong, Mongla, and Payra ports also followed suit and reopened on May 4. While the rest of the ports in India have reopened on May 4, there are no reports to confirm the status of Port of Paradip, which serves as one of the major hubs for India’s coking coal imports. Thus, any prolonged closure or delays to discharge imports may cause backlogs. Moreover, port congestion exacerbated by the recent closures and the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan on May 5, especially in Bangladesh, may result in longer vessel berthing times due to the shifting of working hours at the ports. As a result, clearance of container backlogs may take longer than usual. 

The temporary port closures have not led to any declarations of force majeure by shipping companies or manufacturers. Reports indicate that production at National Aluminium Co Ltd, Reliance Industries Ltd, and Indian Oil Corporation’s Paradip refinery, which produces 300,000 barrels per day, were not affected by the cyclone.
While intermittent disruptions were experienced at state-run companies, operations have been restored at Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited and NTPC Ltd. Talcher coal field, belonging to Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd, was the only mine that halted productions due to the cyclone’s impact. The mine saw a production decline to 4.622 million ton on May 3 from 20.123 million ton on May 2. It remains unclear when productions will resume. 

As the cyclone season in the North Indian Ocean runs from April to December each year, customers with frequent shipments and suppliers in South Asia should initiate business contingency plans. The path and intensity of tropical storms and cyclones are difficult to predict and may change abruptly, affecting port operations which may in turn, change vessel schedules. Customers can also expect cargo handling delays and long dwell times at some of the aforementioned ports given that the first week of Ramadan coincided with the first severe cyclone in the region. For any emergency situation, customers are advised to liaise with local contacts to assess if containers have sustained physical damages and can be recovered.","cyclone fani hit last week heavy rain wind 127 mph swept coastal area india ’ andhra pradesh odisha west bengal state low-lying coastal area bangladesh operation seaport land air service halted country cyclone fani equivalent category 4 storm second-highest five-tier saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale made landfall may 3 puri odisha weakened tropical depression time entered bangladesh although cyclone resulted fewer casualty lesser damage infrastructure initially anticipated residual disruption expected affected region least may 10. commercial flight resumed biju patnaik international airport bhubaneswar delay cancellation likely persist coming day hundred flight private national airline cancelled prior storm additionally total 370 train cancelled india though limited rail service resumed bhubaneswar may 5. service puri also expected resume coming day power outage reported several district odisha 3,000,000 customer without electricity strong wind uprooted communication power line cyclone passage damaging 10,000 pole bhubaneswar alone electricity gradually restored balasore bhadrak keonjhar mayurbhanj may 5 part bhubaneswar expected receive full power supply coming day authority puri stated targeting restore electricity 1,000,000 customer may 6. anticipation cyclone ’ impact seaport located along indian eastern coastal line including paradip gopalpur dhamra visakhapatnam kolkata port trust temporarily suspended operation 24 48-hours may 3. bangladesh chittagong mongla payra port also followed suit reopened may 4. rest port india reopened may 4 report confirm status port paradip serf one major hub india ’ coking coal import thus prolonged closure delay discharge import may cause backlog moreover port congestion exacerbated recent closure start islamic holy month ramadan may 5 especially bangladesh may result longer vessel berthing time due shifting working hour port result clearance container backlog may take longer usual temporary port closure led declaration force majeure shipping company manufacturer report indicate production national aluminium co ltd reliance industry ltd indian oil corporation ’ paradip refinery produce 300,000 barrel per day affected cyclone intermittent disruption experienced state-run company operation restored oil natural gas corporation limited ntpc ltd. talcher coal field belonging mahanadi coalfield ltd mine halted production due cyclone ’ impact mine saw production decline 4.622 million ton may 3 20.123 million ton may 2. remains unclear production resume cyclone season north indian ocean run april december year customer frequent shipment supplier south asia initiate business contingency plan path intensity tropical storm cyclone difficult predict may change abruptly affecting port operation may turn change vessel schedule customer also expect cargo handling delay long dwell time aforementioned port given first week ramadan coincided first severe cyclone region emergency situation customer advised liaise local contact ass container sustained physical damage recovered",Cargo Disruption,Administrative Issue

"An explosion caused damage to the Greek-operated Agrari oil tanker on 25 November while it was about to depart from Saudi Arabia’s port of Shuqaiq in the Jizan region bordering Yemen. The incident came after Yemen-based Houthi militants fired a cruise missile at a Saudi oil facility in the port city of Jeddah on 23 November.Men stand by debris following an attack at the Saudi Aramco oil facility in Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea city of Jeddah on 24 November 2020.Photo by Fayez Nureldine/AFP via Getty ImagesThe attacks are part of the ongoing Houthi campaign targeting strategic infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, which has intensified since early September. The Greek operator of the oil tanker, TMS Tankers, stated that the tanker was “struck about one meter above the waterline and has suffered a breach”, and added that no injuries were reported. Although local and international media speculated that the tanker was hit by a naval mine, Saudi officials described the incident as a “foiled terrorist act” that occurred when an explosive-laden boat launched by the Houthis was intercepted and destroyed. Either way, IHS Markit assesses that the Houthi are the likely perpetrator of the attack, as the militia has used both marine vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (UM-VBIEDs) and floating naval mines to target Saudi commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea. No other group has similar capabilities to target Saudi Arabia.The attack on Jeddah demonstrates that the Houthi are still developing more sophisticated missile capabilities. Saudi officials have acknowledged the attack on Jeddah and satellite imagery accessed by IHS Markit confirmed the damage at a fuel tank at Jeddah distribution station. The Houthis stated that attack was perpetrated using a new cruise missile, called Quds-2, which they have not yet publicly unveiled. Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree, however, said in an interview released on Houthi social media channels that the new missile was developed to fly at lower altitudes with the aim of reducing the effectiveness of anti-missile systems deployed in Saudi Arabia. A member of the Houthi political bureau, Abd al-Wahhab al-Mahbashi, also stated that the missile was being developed to target the city of Eilat, Israel's southernmost city on the Red Sea, given its growing diplomatic rapprochement with Saudi Arabia. The immediate requirement for the missile was to target Jeddah given Saudi ongoing military operations in Yemen against the movement. The latest threat, which extends to Israel, reflects the propensity of the Houthi’s leadership to further escalate against the coalition by expanding its target set. There has been no evidence, however, of Yemeni insurgent use of missiles with a longer range than 1,100 km, which is not sufficient to target Eilat (approximately 1,600 km from the Houthi-controlled northernmost point in Yemen’s Sadaa province). Any attack on Israel would almost certainly bring a very heavy response, not just from Israel but likely from the United States as well. Houthi cross-border attacks into Saudi Arabia and maritime attacks are likely to intensify, as long as the movement and the coalition do not resume formal negotiations. These attacks reflect the current impasse in peace talks brokered by the United Nations, which have failed to produce any tangible outcome since the Hodeidah ceasefire was signed in December 2018. The likely resumption of Saudi airstrikes in Yemen in response to recent attacks, especially around Sanaa, is expected to lead the movement to intensify its cross-border attacks into Saudi Arabia with missiles and armed drones, with airports, oil facilities, and desalination plants in the south of Saudi Arabia at highest risk, particularly Jizan, Abha, and Najran. Given the group’s ready access to UM-VBIEDs and sea mines, the Red Sea coast is also very likely to continue to be an area of active targeting by the Houthi.Indicators of changing risk environmentIncreasing riskHouthi militants start probing attacks on the northern section of the Red Sea, indicating intent to strike Israel.Houthi militants successfully stage an attack using a combination of cruise missiles and drones, inflicting significant damage to Riyadh or Jeddah airport.Houthi militants stage a cross-border ground attack and seize territory inside Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia launches a new campaign of precision airstrikes with Israeli support killing high-profile Houthi leaders.Israel starts covert operations in Yemen.Decreasing riskThe UN calls for a new round of peace talks and both Saudi Arabia and the Houthis agree to implement a ceasefire.&copy; 2020, IHS Markit Inc.

"Four summer houses at lake Lanalhue, in Contulmo, Arauco province, Bío Bío region, Chile were burnt in an arson attack on 28 August. Two were inhabited, with lodgers escaping unharmed. This comes amid a significant escalation of violent acts of sabotage in the southern Chilean regions of Araucanía and Bío Bío, hotspots of Mapuche indigenous violence over land restitution. In addition, on the same day (28 August), extremists burnt eight machines and five vehicles belonging to forestry contractor Gesfor in Lebu, causing losses worth USD4.5 million, according to the company. On 22 August, at least four armed individuals carried out an arson attack against cargo trucks on Route Q182, connecting Collipulli and Angol, in Malleco province, Araucanía. During the incident, the assailants fired several shots at vehicles in transit, injuring a nine-year-old passenger.  Significance: Tourism assets are increasingly becoming the targets of Mapuche-related violence in southern Chile, which has traditionally focused on forestry and agriculture assets. In the past few months, several other vacation houses and local hotels have been attacked as well. This includes tourist areas with no record of attacks, signalling an expansion in hotspots, including sites around lakes Lanalhue and Galletué near Lonquimay and Curacautín, close to natural reserves and national parks, such as Conguillío and Malalcahuello. The roadside attacks suggest that some Mapuche protesters are becoming more indiscriminate in their use of violence, increasing the risk of injury for those in transit. During previous attacks against cargo trucks, casualties were largely avoided by forcing the drivers to leave their vehicles before setting them on fire. A key hotspot is Route 5, specifically in the 45 km between Collipulli and Victoria. A truckers’ strike that began on 27 August in demand of urgent government action to improve security is likely to lead to increased police deployment to the area in the coming days. However, this is likely to only shift the hotspots for attacks instead of reducing them. The government is also likely to accelerate a security agenda currently in Congress, including an anti-terrorism law, in response to truckers’ demands, but the lack of a comprehensive political and land restitution strategy is likely to drive further spikes in violence in the one-year outlook, even if security measures help to contain the current escalation.Risks: TerrorismSectors or assets affected: Tourism; Cargo; Forestry; Individuals&copy; 2020, IHS Markit Inc.

"Philippine police on 13 August arrested an Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) subcommander who is alleged to have orchestrated numerous kidnap-for-ransom operations in the waters and coastal areas of southern Philippines and Malaysia’s Sabah state since 2013. Abduljihad “Idang” Susukan was arrested by Philippine police in Davao City, at the home of Nur Misuari, chairperson of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), one of the two main Moro-Muslim organisations engaged in a peace process with the national government to pacify the Mindanao region through greater regional autonomy. The circumstances surrounding Susukan’s arrest remain unclear: whether he was captured or voluntarily surrendered with Misuari’s assistance. Despite their initial denials, Philippine security forces appeared to have foreknowledge of Susukan’s presence in Davao. Mayor of Davao City Sara Duterte-Carpio, whose father is President Rodrigo Duterte, said on 14 August that she and security officials were aware of Susukan’s trip to Davao from his base in Sulu province. Susukan has 34 arrest warrants against him in the Philippines: for murder, frustrated murder, and kidnapping. He is also on the Malaysian government’s most wanted list.Significance: Susukan’s arrest will likely reduce ASG’s cross-border kidnapping-for-ransom capability in the months to come. Based in Talipao, Sulu, Susukan was distinguished among several ASG subcommanders in a network of local clans that orchestrated the kidnapping, transport, and ransom of captives taken from the waters and littorals of the Sulu Sea. Most notably, he allegedly played a pivotal role in the kidnap-for-ransom operations in 2015 that led to the beheadings of, among others, two Canadians and one Malaysian citizen (see Philippines: 2 May 2016: Hostage beheading raises execution risks for kidnapped foreigners and likely to intensify counter-terrorism operations in the Philippines). The longer-term effect of Susukan’s arrest will depend on his value as a source of actionable intelligence for Philippine security forces as indicated by follow-up operations that lead to the capture or killing of other ASG leaders. Such operations would be potentially highly damaging to the ASG. However, in the absence of successful follow-up operations, the ASG will have the time to recover by replacing Susukan with a less experienced, albeit capable, subcommander.

"On Wednesday, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared to Congress that Hong Kong no longer has “a high degree of autonomy from China” given national security legislation affecting the territory that is under consideration by China’s National People’s Congress (NPC) and other recent developments. The NPC security legislation, which is expected to be passed on Thursday, includes provisions that among other things would allow mainland Chinese security agencies to target individuals in Hong Kong accused of such acts as “sedition” and “subversion,” and is widely viewed as likely to be used against pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong. The report by Secretary Pompeo is the latest in a series of recent moves by US government officials and agencies in response to developments in Hong Kong and elsewhere in China. Last week, a bipartisan bill was proposed in the US Senate that would sanction Chinese companies and individuals involved with the proposed NPC law, and would also sanction banks carrying out large transactions for those under sanctions. Also, late last week, the US Department of Commerce added 33 Chinese companies and institutions to its Entity List, which restricts the export or transfer of US products or items containing US technology to those listed. The groups added to the list, most of which are companies involved in artificial intelligence, facial recognition, or robotics, have been accused by the commerce department of being involved in Chinese government actions against Uighur Muslims and other groups in China’s northwestern Xinjiang region, or of acquiring technology for the Chinese military. On Wednesday, the US House of Representatives passed a bill calling for sanctions against Chinese officials involved in the Xinjiang actions, which will now go to the president following its earlier passage by the Senate.



Assessment: All of the moves by US officials and agencies come amid an uptick in tensions between the US and China in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and as the two countries continue to experience ongoing trade issues. Hong Kong has recently reemerged as a more major issue for some US policymakers as pro-democracy protests resume following COVID-19 restrictions and especially following the surprise introduction of the NPC legislation last week. The US Senate bill, proposed by Senators Chris Van Hollen and Pat Toomey, was already being formulated as a general defense of Hong Kong human rights, but was altered and accelerated following the proposed NPC law. Secretary Pompeo’s report to Congress on Wednesday was part of required annual reporting from the state department to Congress regarding Hong Kong’s political status vis-à-vis mainland control. The reporting requirement is part of amendments made last year to the US-Hong Kong Policy Act, which was originally passed by the US in 1992 and assures Hong Kong separate treatment from mainland China in its trade and economic relationship with the US. The report on Hong Kong’s autonomy from the state department is merely advisory and will not by itself result in any consequences; however, media reports citing sources within the administration of President Donald Trump suggest that the administration is considering placing Hong Kong under the same tariff regime that is in place for the mainland. No move in this direction has been confirmed though, and it would require at least an executive order from the president. Fully expanding China tariffs to Hong Kong would be a major step and is probably unlikely at this time, although some more targeted measures are possible. Some 1,300 US companies operate in Hong Kong currently and there was approximately US $66 billion in trade between the US and the territory in 2018. In addition to the likely passage by the NPC of the security legislation on Thursday, any additional crackdowns on ongoing protests in Hong Kong against the legislation are likely to further aggravate the US-China relationship. Those with economic interests in Hong Kong are advised to follow developments.","wednesday united state secretary state mike pompeo declared congress hong kong longer “ high degree autonomy china ” given national security legislation affecting territory consideration china ’ national people ’ congress npc recent development npc security legislation expected passed thursday includes provision among thing would allow mainland chinese security agency target individual hong kong accused act “ sedition ” “ subversion ” widely viewed likely used pro-democracy demonstrator hong kong report secretary pompeo latest series recent move u government official agency response development hong kong elsewhere china last week bipartisan bill proposed u senate would sanction chinese company individual involved proposed npc law would also sanction bank carrying large transaction sanction also late last week u department commerce added 33 chinese company institution entity list restricts export transfer u product item containing u technology listed group added list company involved artificial intelligence facial recognition robotics accused commerce department involved chinese government action uighur muslim group china ’ northwestern xinjiang region acquiring technology chinese military wednesday u house representative passed bill calling sanction chinese official involved xinjiang action go president following earlier passage senate assessment move u official agency come amid uptick tension u china wake covid-19 pandemic two country continue experience ongoing trade issue hong kong recently reemerged major issue u policymakers pro-democracy protest resume following covid-19 restriction especially following surprise introduction npc legislation last week u senate bill proposed senator chris van hollen pat toomey already formulated general defense hong kong human right altered accelerated following proposed npc law secretary pompeo ’ report congress wednesday part required annual reporting state department congress regarding hong kong ’ political status vis-à-vis mainland control reporting requirement part amendment made last year us-hong kong policy act originally passed u 1992 assures hong kong separate treatment mainland china trade economic relationship u report hong kong ’ autonomy state department merely advisory result consequence however medium report citing source within administration president donald trump suggest administration considering placing hong kong tariff regime place mainland move direction confirmed though would require least executive order president fully expanding china tariff hong kong would major step probably unlikely time although targeted measure possible 1,300 u company operate hong kong currently approximately u 66 billion trade u territory 2018. addition likely passage npc security legislation thursday additional crackdown ongoing protest hong kong legislation likely aggravate us-china relationship economic interest hong kong advised follow development","Regulatory Advisory, Political Info / Event, Protest / Riot",Administrative Issue

"In Panama City, members of the National Union of Workers of Construction and Similar Industries (Sindicato Único Nacional de Trabajadores de la Industria de la Construcción y Similares: SUNTRACS) marched on 13 October towards the Ministry of Labour to demand the reactivation of employment contracts of construction-sector workers. Similar protests have been conducted nationwide in the last three weeks and are scheduled to take place today (21 October) in Panama City. In response, the Panamanian Chamber of Construction has stated that around 20% of nationwide construction projects are unable to resume because the Panamanian government owes companies in the sector USD200 million relating to public-sector works. The apparent cash-flow squeeze comes after the government lifted restrictions for the construction sector in September, with the gradual reopening of the economy following a surge in the number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases during May–July. Significance: The ongoing protests by SUNTRACS and the continuing complaints by the construction sector about unpaid debts highlight the increasing frequency of state non-payment to suppliers. Although the government has been successful in issuing bonds in the international market to fund its budget, inadequate capacity to manage payments during the COVID-19-virus crisis has highlighted inefficiencies within the state administration. In recent months, this has been indicated by repeated complaints involving multiple sectors about delays in payment over services related to the COVID-19-virus pandemic, with healthcare-sector workers demanding unpaid wages and agricultural producers denouncing arrears in connection with COVID-19-virus-related welfare programmes; business chambers assess that the state owes USD500 million to COVID-19-virus-related suppliers. Inadequate government capacity to settle arrears with construction companies, despite the administration defining this as a priority sector to reactivate the economy (as it employs 10% of the active private-sector workforce and contributes 15% to Panama’s GDP), indicates that non-payment risks in other sectors are likely to deteriorate within months. Extended payment delays affecting construction companies would hinder the sector’s reactivation as well as increase the risks of protests by SUNTRACS continuing, with a mounting likelihood of significant logistical disruption including roadblocks and vandalism to public and private property, mainly in Panama City and near Colón port.

"On Wednesday, it was reported that severe gas shortages were occurring across Dhaka and Chittagong since Sunday. The shortage is a result of a technical glitch at a floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal, which has caused a deficit of 150 million cubic feet of gas per day. Remaining gas supplies have been prioritized for power generation and industrial operations that produce fertilizer. Households and compressed natural gas (CNG) filling stations have reported significant drops in pressure as a result. 
 
	 
		Assessment: Authorities have been attempting to fix the glitch, but there have not been any reports regarding when service is expected to normalize. While some factories are receiving gas supplies, other companies in the country s garment sector have reported production disruptions due to the fact that they are unable to run gas-fired generators.

"Solidarity protests and blockades have continued across Canada and are leading to exacerbating disruptions to the cross-country rail network run by CN Rail and VIA Rail. These solidarity actions are in support of the Wet suwet en people who have been blocking pipeline construction through their territory in northwestern British Columbia. The solidarity actions have forced CN Rail to shut down freight service throughout eastern Canada and VIA rail has canceled all trains throughout the country. VIA Rail service was expected to resume on Thursday between Montreal and Quebec City; however, a new blockade in Saint-Lambert has delayed the resumption of service. As of this writing, VIA rail service between Montreal and Ottawa is scheduled to resume on Saturday and service between Windsor and Quebec City is expected to resume on Sunday. 

Assessment: In addition to the rail disruptions, the ongoing blockades have led both VIA Rail and CN Rail to temporary lay off workers, approximately 1,000 for VIA and 450 for CN, due to the temporary stoppage in services. CN Rail has obtained a court-ordered injunction to end the blockades; however, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has held off on ordering enforcement of the injunction over fear that forceful removal will cause additional protests around the country. Officials have warned that if the blockades remain and rail service continues to be suspended, factories and other industrial operations may have to also begin temporarily laying off close to 6,000 workers due to limited storage ability of finished products and critical supplies. 

It is estimated that CAN $435 million of goods have been stranded daily due to the ongoing freight rail suspension. CN estimates that it transports approximately CAN $250 billion of goods every year across the Canadian railway. This includes a wide variety of retail and consumer goods, including perishable food items, agricultural products, and propane supplies. The disruptions are especially noticeable to Eastern Canada and the Atlantic provinces, which heavily rely on the CN Rail network for cross-country shipment of such resources and products. Some companies have begun using trucks to haul goods such as petrochemicals but this a temporary fix that is still forcing companies to scale back production levels. Ports across Canada are also experiencing disruptions due to the rail network suspension and while ports continue to operate normally at this time, a number of them including the Port of Vancouver, have reported backlogs of ships and containers which will be exacerbated the longer the rail suspension continues. 

As of this writing, there is no indication that blockades and protests are expected to end soon. The continuance of rail disruptions will likely begin to cause significant issues to additional industries and farmers who rely on the rail network to transport and process their goods and products. Likewise, consumers may begin to see shortages of some products, especially perishable foods, if the blockades continue. Atlantic Canada will likely have the most noticeable shortages due to the far distance from Vancouver, where a large number of products come through the port, and from central Canada where a significant amount of the processing and manufacturing is done. 

The possibility of further blockades and protests remains high across the country. It remains to be seen if officials will begin using force to disband blockades and this action would likely be seen as a significant escalation by activists and as such, additional protest activity would be likely to occur. Customers with supply-chain interests are advised to continue monitoring developments and expect continued and possibly worsening disruptions. Additionally, all protest activity should be avoided due to the potential for clashes and disruptive behavior.","solidarity protest blockade continued across canada leading exacerbating disruption cross-country rail network run cn rail via rail solidarity action support wet suwet en people blocking pipeline construction territory northwestern british columbia solidarity action forced cn rail shut freight service throughout eastern canada via rail canceled train throughout country via rail service expected resume thursday montreal quebec city however new blockade saint-lambert delayed resumption service writing via rail service montreal ottawa scheduled resume saturday service windsor quebec city expected resume sunday assessment addition rail disruption ongoing blockade led via rail cn rail temporary lay worker approximately 1,000 via 450 cn due temporary stoppage service cn rail obtained court-ordered injunction end blockade however prime minister justin trudeau held ordering enforcement injunction fear forceful removal cause additional protest around country official warned blockade remain rail service continues suspended factory industrial operation may also begin temporarily laying close 6,000 worker due limited storage ability finished product critical supply estimated 435 million good stranded daily due ongoing freight rail suspension cn estimate transport approximately 250 billion good every year across canadian railway includes wide variety retail consumer good including perishable food item agricultural product propane supply disruption especially noticeable eastern canada atlantic province heavily rely cn rail network cross-country shipment resource product company begun using truck haul good petrochemical temporary fix still forcing company scale back production level port across canada also experiencing disruption due rail network suspension port continue operate normally time number including port vancouver reported backlog ship container exacerbated longer rail suspension continues writing indication blockade protest expected end soon continuance rail disruption likely begin cause significant issue additional industry farmer rely rail network transport process good product likewise consumer may begin see shortage product especially perishable food blockade continue atlantic canada likely noticeable shortage due far distance vancouver large number product come port central canada significant amount processing manufacturing done possibility blockade protest remains high across country remains seen official begin using force disband blockade action would likely seen significant escalation activist additional protest activity would likely occur customer supply-chain interest advised continue monitoring development expect continued possibly worsening disruption additionally protest activity avoided due potential clash disruptive behavior",Public Transportation Disruption,Administrative Issue

"On December 25, the Middle East Monitor reported that a document leaked from the Iraqi Ministry of Interior revealed a plan to target a US base in Baghdad on the anniversary of the assassination of Qasem Soleimani. The Middle East Monitor report cited local media outlets claiming that the document outlined intentions to “target the Victoria US military base, near Baghdad’s airport, with advanced technology missiles.” The purported document did not specify any further details regarding the planned attack, including the groups involved, and the veracity of the report has not been independently verified. 



Qasem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) Quds Force, was killed in a US drone strike on January 3, 2020 in Baghdad. The head of the Iranian-backed Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) militia, Abu Mahdi al Muhandis was also killed in the raid. 



Assessment: Though the report of the leaked document has not been verified, there is a credible risk for retaliatory attacks on US troops alongside the January 3 anniversary of Soleimani’s death. As the assassination of Soleimani was a highly emotive event, sparking widespread demonstrations throughout Iran last January, public opinion could add pressure for Iran to visibly respond on or near the flashpoint date. However, despite increased tensions between Washington and Tehran over the past week, open military conflict between the rivals remains unlikely. The recent assassination of Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh on November 27 in Tehran raised tensions amongst the regional adversaries, as Tehran blames the US and Israel for the attack. On Sunday, December 20, eight rockets were fired on Baghdad’s Green Zone, near the US Embassy, which injured one person. Following the attack, on December 23 US President Donald Trump blamed Iran-backed militias for the rockets and said that he would hold Iran responsible for any American deaths in Iraq. Also, reports emerged of roadside bombs targeting US convoys in Diwaniyah and Samawah on December 29 and December 25, respectively. Although Iran has the capability to target the US military and other interests in areas including Iraq, as well as allied foreign troops and maritime interests in the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz, the country is more likely to act through its multitude of regional proxies. Such attacks typically include rockets and missiles fired near the US Embassy in Baghdad and targeting US convoys with improvised explosive devices. If Iran overtly carries out a retaliatory strike on US, or allied interests, Washington could respond in kind and possibly escalate the situation further, particularly if US citizens are killed. There is also a heightened possibility of commemorative demonstrations and protests leading up to January 3 in areas including Tehran, Baghdad, and possibly Bahrain, where there is a large Shia population. Those with regional interests are advised to closely monitor related security developments.",december 25 middle east monitor reported document leaked iraqi ministry interior revealed plan target u base baghdad anniversary assassination qasem soleimani middle east monitor report cited local medium outlet claiming document outlined intention “ target victoria u military base near baghdad ’ airport advanced technology missiles. ” purported document specify detail regarding planned attack including group involved veracity report independently verified qasem soleimani head iran ’ islamic revolutionary guard corp irgc quds force killed u drone strike january 3 2020 baghdad head iranian-backed popular mobilization force pmf militia abu mahdi al muhandis also killed raid assessment though report leaked document verified credible risk retaliatory attack u troop alongside january 3 anniversary soleimani ’ death assassination soleimani highly emotive event sparking widespread demonstration throughout iran last january public opinion could add pressure iran visibly respond near flashpoint date however despite increased tension washington tehran past week open military conflict rival remains unlikely recent assassination iranian nuclear scientist mohsen fakhrizadeh november 27 tehran raised tension amongst regional adversary tehran blame u israel attack sunday december 20 eight rocket fired baghdad ’ green zone near u embassy injured one person following attack december 23 u president donald trump blamed iran-backed militia rocket said would hold iran responsible american death iraq also report emerged roadside bomb targeting u convoy diwaniyah samawah december 29 december 25 respectively although iran capability target u military interest area including iraq well allied foreign troop maritime interest persian gulf strait hormuz country likely act multitude regional proxy attack typically include rocket missile fired near u embassy baghdad targeting u convoy improvised explosive device iran overtly carry retaliatory strike u allied interest washington could respond kind possibly escalate situation particularly u citizen killed also heightened possibility commemorative demonstration protest leading january 3 area including tehran baghdad possibly bahrain large shia population regional interest advised closely monitor related security development,"Military Operations, Protest / Riot, Public Safety / Security, Security Advisory",Human Error

"On Sunday, Turkey’s health minister announced 61 new deaths attributed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) over the previous 24 hours. The toll was the lowest reported in Turkey since March 31 and took the number of COVID-19-related deaths in the country to 3,397. Turkey’s coronavirus case tally also rose to 120,045 on Sunday after authorities recorded 1,670 new infections, making the country the eighth-most affected in the world in terms of positive cases. More than 68,000 people have recovered, and the number of active cases stood a roughly 62,500 as of May 3.



Assessment: The development suggests that Turkey’s COVID-19 pandemic is stabilizing. With officials indicating that the country’s coronavirus curve will soon begin a downward trend, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced the partial easing of anti-virus efforts from Monday, including the lifting of a ban on entry and exit by land, air, and sea to the provinces of Erzurum, Aydin, Hatay, Malatya, Mersin, Antalya, and Mugla, and the relaxing of confinement orders for individuals under the age of 20 and above 65, allowing senior and youth citizens to go outside for four hours for one day a week starting next weekend. Inter-city travel restrictions remain in place in 24 other provinces, including Ankara, Istanbul, and Izmir. Shopping malls, barber shops, and some stores will be allowed to open on May 11, provided they adhere to social distancing and other health guidelines, while university classes are slated to resume on June 15. That said, Erdoğan indicated that the plan remains subject to conditions on the ground, with reopening dates potentially pushed back or brought forward, or new restrictions imposed, in the event of a resurgence of the virus or non-compliance by the public. Thus, while coronavirus restrictions are being eased in Turkey, the possibility of residual travel and logistical disruptions cannot be ruled out. Likewise, from a security standpoint, the economic toll inflicted by the pandemic and the government’s efforts to contain it have likely aggravated socioeconomic tensions, raising the possibility of protests. However, as was evidenced by the quick dispersal of activists seeking to commemorate International Workers’ Day in Ankara and Istanbul last Friday, any gatherings that do materialize are likely to be quickly suppressed by security forces.","sunday turkey ’ health minister announced 61 new death attributed coronavirus disease 2019 covid-19 previous 24 hour toll lowest reported turkey since march 31 took number covid-19-related death country 3,397. turkey ’ coronavirus case tally also rose 120,045 sunday authority recorded 1,670 new infection making country eighth-most affected world term positive case 68,000 people recovered number active case stood roughly 62,500 may 3. assessment development suggests turkey ’ covid-19 pandemic stabilizing official indicating country ’ coronavirus curve soon begin downward trend president recep tayyip erdoğan announced partial easing anti-virus effort monday including lifting ban entry exit land air sea province erzurum aydin hatay malatya mersin antalya mugla relaxing confinement order individual age 20 65 allowing senior youth citizen go outside four hour one day week starting next weekend inter-city travel restriction remain place 24 province including ankara istanbul izmir shopping mall barber shop store allowed open may 11 provided adhere social distancing health guideline university class slated resume june 15. said erdoğan indicated plan remains subject condition ground reopening date potentially pushed back brought forward new restriction imposed event resurgence virus non-compliance public thus coronavirus restriction eased turkey possibility residual travel logistical disruption ruled likewise security standpoint economic toll inflicted pandemic government ’ effort contain likely aggravated socioeconomic tension raising possibility protest however evidenced quick dispersal activist seeking commemorate international worker ’ day ankara istanbul last friday gathering materialize likely quickly suppressed security force","Public Health Advisory, Ground Transportation Advisory, Public Safety / Security, Security Advisory",Administrative Issue
