Tehran did not attribute responsibility immediately but said two explosions 20 minutes apart on the Sabiti tanker, which caused oil to spill from two tanks, were not the result of an accident.

The boat was about 60 miles from the Saudi Arabian port city of Jeddah when it was hit. The scale of the damage did not appear extensive in photos published by Tehran news agencies.

The blasts prompted speculation that they were a reprisal by Gulf states for attacks attributed to Iran on Saudi oil assets in September.

Meanwhile, the Pentagon announced it was sending at least 1,000 additional troops to Saudi Arabia. It said the deployment meant that in the past month 3,000 troops had been sent to the kingdom or had their deployment extended.

US Patriot missile defences failed to deter a cruise missile and drone attack that severely damaged two Aramco facilities and shocked the Saudi government last month. US officials have since discussed with their Middle Eastern ally how to strengthen Saudi defences, and the Pentagon said Friday’s deployment would “assure and enhance the defence of Saudi Arabia”.

This week Donald Trump announced he was pulling troops from the Syrian border with Turkey and said he wanted to end America’s endless wars in the Middle East.

It appears some of the newly announced troops are being despatched to replace other American forces expected to depart the region in the coming weeks.

The US and the EU attributed the September attack to Iran, rejecting claims by Houthi rebels in Yemen that they were responsible. A full UN report on the incident has not yet been completed

An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman said: “Those behind the attack are responsible for the consequences of this dangerous adventure, including the dangerous environmental pollution caused. The details and factors behind this act will be investigated and will be announced after the results are reached.”

Suggestions that the oil company that owned the tanker was blaming Saudi Arabia at this stage were denied.

Friday’s incident, if confirmed as an attack, would be the first such incident targeting Iranian-owned shipping in the Gulf, though a state-owned tanker, Grace 1, was seized by British authorities off Gibraltar on the basis that it was breaching an EU oil embargo.

Iranian news agencies stressed that the Sabiti was stable, no crew had been injured and the leak was being brought under control.

Iranian ships routinely turn off their transponders to prevent tracking, but the Sabiti turned on its tracking devices late on Friday morning in the Red Sea, according to data from MarineTraffic.com.

The vessel last turned on its tracking devices in August, showing it near the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas.

Dryad Global, a firm specialising in oil shipping intelligence, said the vessel’s proximity to the port of Jeddah made it plausible that Saudi Arabia could have been involved, or at the very least that the incident was intended to create the perception of Saudi involvement.

But it added: “In terms of Saudi interests within the region, it remains unclear why Saudi would seek to target Iran in this manner. An attack of relatively low sophistication with limited and almost negligible strategic gain would be highly irregular and not serve any Saudi strategic narrative. Further still, it is highly unlikely that the Saudis would risk an ecological disaster in an area of strategic significance such as the Red Sea.”

Tension in the strait of Hormuz has been heightened for months as the US and Iran spar over Washington’s decision in 2018 to withdraw from the Iranian nuclear deal and impose worldwide sanctions on Iran including its oil exports.

Q&A Why is the Gulf of Oman so important for shipping oil? Show The strait of Hormuz, which provides passage from the Gulf of Oman to the open sea, is the most important gateway for oil exports in the world. With Iran on its northern shore, and the UAE and Oman on its southern shore, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) calls it the world’s worst 'chokepoint' In 2016, 18.5m barrels of crude oil were transported each day through the strait of Hormuz, compared with 16m through the strait of Malacca, which runs between the Indonesian island of Sumatra, Malaysia and Thailand, connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea. 5m barrels of crude oil are transported annually through the next largest chokepoint, the Suez canal. Phillip Inman Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

An attempt by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, at the UN general assembly in New York to engineer a meeting between the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, and Trump failed as the two sides could not reach agreement on the sequencing of the compromises the two sides would have to take. Since then, the Pakistani prime minister, Imran Khan, has stepped forward as a possible mediator between Iran and Saudi Arabia.

The perception was that neither Saudi Arabia nor the UAE, Iran’s two main Gulf rivals, were looking to escalate the crisis by undertaking a military response to the Aramco incident. It would be surprising if either Gulf state resorted to the kind of “plausible deniability” tactics allegedly deployed by Iran.

Israel is also deeply hostile to Iran but has confined most of its attacks to Iranian military sites in Syria.

The current round of attacks on oil shipping started on 12 May when four ships, including two Saudi oil tankers, were attacked in the Gulf just outside the strait of Hormuz, which is a major oil shipping route.

US and British officials blamed Iran, a charge Tehran denies. A further two tankers were hit on 13 June, and a week later Iran said it had shot down a US surveillance drone, an attack that nearly led to a major reprisal by the Trump administration.

Anthony Bucci, an agency spokesman, said the meat was ""primarily cured,"" and the cargo containers were not refrigerated.

The deadly disease, which does not affect humans, has never been detected among livestock in this country, NJ.com reported. But, if a domestic outbreak were to occur, a customs official said, it could cause $10 billion worth of damage to the U.S. pork industry in one year.

Port workers took the helicopter to the APM Terminals Valencia facilities, specifically to a restricted access area controlled by security guards.

According to investigations, a member of the gang must have got spooked by police surveillance or for another unknown reason and not come for the delivery.

There were no arrests in the operation.

This criminal tactic, known as a blind hook or ‘rip-off’, consists of hiding the cocaine in a container with legal merchandise in the country of origin, without the knowledge of the exporter or importer, and then withdrawing the drug at the port destination before the cargo reaches the end of the route.

In this way, the drug traffickers often bypass customs controls in Valencia.

Joan Sánchez

Ride-hailing services Uber and Cabify announced on Thursday that they would be pulling their services out of Barcelona from tomorrow onward. The companies are doing so in response to the approval by the Catalan regional government of regulations that will force customers to request their services 15 minutes ahead of their planned journey time.

The new law from the Generalitat, as the regional government is known, was passed in response to demands from taxi drivers, who have been on strike in Barcelona and Madrid in recent days over what they consider to be unfair competition from Uber and Cabify drivers, who operate in Spain using what are known as VTC (private hire) licenses.

Uber has sent a message to its users, entitled: “So long Barcelona”

Stoppages in Barcelona were suspended last week but continue in Madrid, with drivers having blocked a number of areas of the city over the last seven days, as well as staging noisy demonstrations outside the headquarters of the conservative Popular Party (PP), which is in power in the Madrid regional government.

Uber neither owns cars nor licenses in Spain, and it limits its activities to simply offering the technology platform that drivers can use to find customers. But it will be affected by the move that it and its competitor Cabify have made. The American firm has sent a message to its users, entitled: “So long Barcelona,” in which it blames the regional government for the closure of the UberX service it was offering in the Catalan capital.

For its part, Cabify – which does own VTC licenses at the same time as working with other companies, to whom it offers its technology platform – will contact its users on Friday to convey what it considers to be its “expulsion” from Catalonia.

“Nearly a year ago we returned to Barcelona with one commitment: to do things properly,” reads the statement released by Uber. “Since then, more than half a million people have chosen us to get them around the city. And thousands of drivers have found a way to make a living with Uber.”

Several years ago now, the San Francisco-based firm tried to launch in Spain the model that brought it so much success in its home country: i.e. a platform that allowed anyone with a car to essentially be a taxi driver. But it was quickly forced to close its service due to protests from the taxi sector and legal challenges, and in 2018 it returned with a service that observed Spanish law and regulations, using VTC licenses. This activity will now be curtailed by the regional government decree, which is aimed at differentiating the activity of taxis and that of VTC vehicles.

VTC drivers have also been out on the streets to demonstrate, in opposition to the government decree. Uber and Cabify have announced that the measure will cost more than 3,500 people their jobs. “The obligation to wait 15 minutes to travel in a VTC vehicle does not exist in any other place in Europe, and it is completely incompatible with the immediacy of on-demand services such as UberX,” the company statement continues.

Stoppages in Barcelona were suspended last week but continue in Madrid

For its part, Cabify has released a statement in which it condemns the Generalitat for “having given in to the pressure and demands of the taxi sector, seriously damaging the interest of citizens.” It adds that it believes the 15-minute wait time will make its business inviable, given that 98.5% of its journeys are offered below that time frame.

Meanwhile, the spokesperson for Élite Taxi in Barcelona, Alberto Tito Álvarez, released a statement in which he celebrated the decision by Uber and Cabify to end their services in Barcelona. “This is a victory for working people against the enslaving multinationals, and not just of the taxis,” he said. He criticized the fact that these companies had created what he called “a fraudulent business model,” and assured that the new regulation would put an end to the model.

The direct consequence of the two companies pulling out of Barcelona will fall on the more than 3,500 drivers with VTC licenses in the city. A company called Vector Ronda, for example, which has a workforce of nearly a thousand people and operates mostly with Cabify, has already announced to its workers that it will be executing a mass layoff plan, known in Spanish as an ERE. However, it is yet to officially notify the regional labor department of this plan. In a statement, Spanish union CCOO rejected the ERE, saying that “these announcements are designed to exert pressure on a political decision, making use of workers.”
